<h1>Report a Bug</h1>
<p>
Before you report a bug, please verify that you are running
the latest version of PySolFC, and also check the PySolFC site's
<a href="https://pysolfc.sourceforge.io/faq.html">FAQ page</a>,
and issues previously reported on GitHub, to ensure that the bug
was not previously reported.
<p>
If you found a bug in PySolFC, the best place to report it
is on GitHub.  To do so, create an issue at
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC/issues">https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC/issues</a>
with as much detail as possible on what's happening, and we
will investigate.
<p>
Alternatively, you can report bugs on SourceForge on the
discussion forum at
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/pysolfc/discussion/">https://sourceforge.net/p/pysolfc/discussion/</a>
or through SourceForge's ticketing system at
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/pysolfc/_list/tickets">https://sourceforge.net/p/pysolfc/_list/tickets</a>.
However, these are not checked as frequently as GitHub.

<h2>Enhancements and Feature Requests</h2>
<p>
If you have an enhancement or a new feature for PySolFC you'd
like to request, this can also be done by creating issues in
the same place.
