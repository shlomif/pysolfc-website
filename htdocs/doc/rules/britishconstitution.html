<h1>British Constitution</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This game only uses the ranks from ace through jack.  The
kings and queens are removed.
<p>
The aces are dealt to the foundation, and a card is dealt to
each tableau pile.  There are four rows of eight tableau piles.
The tableau piles are built down by alternate color, so only the
top card is visible, and only cards from the row directly below
can be moved to a tableau pile.  Only one card can be moved at
a time.
<p>
Cards are dealt one at a time from the stock, and can be moved to
the bottommost tableau row only.  Empty spaces in the bottom row
of the tableau are immediately filled from the waste pile.  No
redeal is allowed.
<p>
The foundations are built up by suit from ace to jack, but only
cards from the top tableau row can be moved to the foundations.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
In this game, the foundations are often called the "Government" with
the tableau called the "Constitution", the top row being the "Privy
Council" and the bottom being the "People Row".
<p>
In the rules written by Lady Cadogan, the queen of diamonds and eight
kings are placed above the foundations, with the queen being the
"Sovereign", the red kings being the "Judges", and the black kings
the "Bishops".  Since their role is entirely thematic and decorative,
this is left out of most modern variants of the game, though it does
explain why they are omitted from the deck.
