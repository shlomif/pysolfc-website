<h1>Matsya</h1>
Dashavatara Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to
<a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>.
The rows build down by rank only.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The cards on the tableau build down in rank regardless of suit.  The
foundations build up in rank by suit starting with the Ace.  The cards
are dealt from the talon one at a time.  There is no redeal.  Only Mirs
(Kings) may be played on an empty row.  Cards may not be played from the
foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
The waste stack will be the biggest problem area.  Play from it first.
