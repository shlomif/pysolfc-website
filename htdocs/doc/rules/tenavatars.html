<h1>Ten Avatars</h1>
Dashavatara Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.
<h3>Object</h3>
Arrange all cards in suit and rank order on the tableau.
<h3>Quick description</h3>
The cards may be built down by rank only on the tableau.  The twelve
reserve stacks hold one card each.  The game is won when all cards are
on the tableau in suit and rank order.
<h3>Rules</h3>
The game begins with five cards on each of the ten rows and the twelve
reserve stacks empty.  Cards are dealt from the talon ten at a time, one
to each row.  Rows can be built with cards of any suit in descending rank.
Only Rajas can be played on an empty row.  All ten suits must be in
descending rank order for the game to be won.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
Make as many plays as possible without filling too many reserves before taking
another deal.  Put a priority on getting the Rajas and Pradhans in place.
