<h1>Royal Rendezvous</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
There are eight foundations, structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>On the top row, four foundations built up by same suit from
ace to king.  An ace of each suit is dealt to each of these.</li>
<li>On the top row, to the left and right of the first foundations,
two pairs of foundations that only accept a single king of each
suit each.</li>
<li>On the bottom row, a set of found foundations built up by same
suit using odd-numbered ranks, from ace to jack.  These are built
in the sequence A-3-5-7-9-J.  The remaining four aces are dealt to
these foundations.</li>
<li>On the bottom row, two pairs of foundations on each side of the
ace foundation mentioned above.  These are built up by suit from twos,
using the even numbered ranks, in the sequence 2-4-6-8-10-Q.  A two
of each suit is dealt to each of these.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sixteen cards are dealt to reserve piles.  Cards from these reserves
can only be moved to the foundation.  Empty reserve piles are filled
from the waste pile.  Cards are dealt one at a time from the talon to
the waste pile, and can also be moved to the foundations.  No redeal is
allowed.  The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
