<h1>Great Wall</h1>
<p>
Hanafuda type. 4 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards can be played on the tableau by suits or by rank.
Plum 1 plays on Pine 1, Maple 3 on Mum 3, Pine 2 on
Phoenix 2, etc.  Any second rank card can be played on
any first.  The third and fourth ranks are interchangeable
for all suits.  Only first rank cards can be played on the
canvas.  There can be no more than 26 cards in a row.
<p>
The foundations are of two types.  The finish foundations
at the top on the left and right, and the build foundations
on the bottom.  Cards must be played on the foundations by
rank in suit order.  The finish foundations will only accept
cards as a complete set of all twelve suits.  The build
foundations will accept only one card at a time.
The finish foundations will accept three complete sets
of suits.  The build foundations will accept one.  When
all four decks are on the foundations in order, you have
won.  Cards can be moved from the build foundations to
the finish foundations or to the tableau.  They cannot
be moved from the finish foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Since any particular card will usually play in several
different places on the tableau it's probably possible to
win every hand of Great Wall.
<p>
Hint: don't play all your first rank cards on the foundations
until all the cards are face up.
