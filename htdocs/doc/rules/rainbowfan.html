<h1>Rainbow Fan</h1>
<p>
Fan game type. 2 decks. 3 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
There are eight foundations.  At the start of the game, a king of
each suit is placed on the bottom of four of them, and an ace on the
other four.  The foundations that start with a king are built down
by suit, while the ones that start with an ace are built up.
<p>
The tableau consists of twenty piles of three cards, and may be
built up or down by suit.  When building tableau piles, sequences
can turn the corner, so aces may be played on kings and vice versa.
However, this cannot be done in the foundation.
<p>
If there are still cards in the talon, three cards are dealt from
the talon to fill in empty tableau piles.  Once the talon is empty,
empty tableau piles can no longer be filled.
<p>
Three redeals are allowed.  During each redeal, the bottom card of
each tableau pile is moved to the top of that pile.  The remaining
cards are unmoved.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
This game is traditionally known as Rainbow - it is often renamed
Rainbow Fan to avoid confusion with <a href="rainbow.html">a Canfield
variation of the same name</a>.
