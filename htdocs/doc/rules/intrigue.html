<h1>Intrigue</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Intrigue is a solitaire card game which is played using two decks of playing
cards. It is similar to another solitaire game of
<a href="saliclaw.html">Salic Law</a>, but it also involves the queens and
building in the foundations goes both ways.
<p>
First, one queen is removed from the rest of the deck is placed on the layout
as the base for the first tableau column.
<p>
As they become available, all fives and sixes are placed at the foundations
above the queens. The fives are built down to Aces, then to Kings while the
sixes are built up to Jacks, all regardless of suit.
<p>
Over the first queen, the cards are dealt over it until another queen appears.
This new queen becomes the base for a new tableau column and cards are dealt
over it. This is repeated until all eight queens are uncovered and all cards
are deal.
<p>
During the dealing, all fives and sixes are immediately placed in the
foundations and any card that be built on the foundations must be placed
there.
<p>
Once all cards are dealt and all those that can be built in the foundations
make their way there, building continues. The top cards of each column is
available for play on the foundations. A column containing only a queen is
considered empty and any card can be placed on it. There is no building in the
tableau.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are build on the foundations with the face
cards on top.
<p>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>
Below are harder variations of Intrigue:
<ul>
<li>In <b>Laggard Lady</b>, the fives and sixes may not be moved faster then
the queens. Therefore, for example, if there are five queens dealt so far, a
sixth five or a sixth six must be dealt to the tableau.
<li>In <b>Glencoe</b>, each five and six must be placed over the queen of its
respective suit. If the appropriate queen is not yet available at a time a
five or six appears, that five or six must be dealt to the tableau.
</ul>
