<h1>Accordion</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Remove all cards but one to a single pile.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock in a sequence.  If two cards of the same
suit or rank are next to each other, or separated by exactly two cards,
the card that is further to the left (in PySol, this is the card that is
further from the deck) may be moved on top of the other.
<p>
The game is won when only one card remains.
