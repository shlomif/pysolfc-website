<h1>Measure</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of eight tableau piles.
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time,
and can be moved to tableau piles, which are built
regardless of suit and rank, but once in the tableau,
cards can only be moved to the foundation.
<p>
There is only a single foundation pile, built up by
rank regardless of suit, turning the corner from king to
ace as necessary, starting from any rank.  The game is
won if all cards are moved to this one foundation.
