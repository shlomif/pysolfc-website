<h1>Hidden Passages</h1>
Klondike type. One deck. One redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="blindalleys.html">Blind Alleys</a>
with <a href="../hexadeck.html">Hex A Deck</a>
variations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Blind Alleys.  The rows build down in rank in alternate
color.  Any card or sequence may be played on an empty row.  The Wizards
will play in their proper rank position on the tableau as the alternate
of either red or black.  Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time.
The four suit Aces are dealt to the foundations at the start of the
game.  Cards may be played from the foundations.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
The Wizards will not play to their foundation until all the suit cards
are on theirs.  This can make the end game a real challenge.
