<h1>Pagoda</h1>
<p>
Hanafuda type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
When the hand is dealt, the twenty reserve stacks of the pagoda
are filled with cards.  The twelve foundation stacks on the
right are labeled with the names of the twelve suits.  Cards are
played on the foundations first upwards from the fourth rank to
the first, then downwards from first to fourth.  When the first
card is played on a foundation, the label changes from the suit
name to "Rising".  When the fifth card is played, the label
changes to "Setting".  When the last card is played, the label
reverts to the suit name.  Cards can be played on the foundations
from the reserve stacks or from the waste stack.  An empty foundation
will only accept the fourth rank card of the correct suit.  Cards
are dealt from the talon four at a time, and there is only one
round.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Hint: it's important to keep one or more reserve stacks open
during the early stages of the game.
