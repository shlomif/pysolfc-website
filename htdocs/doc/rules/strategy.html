<h1>Strategy</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, the aces are dealt to the foundations.
<p>
One card is flipped over at a time and moved onto one of eight the row stacks.
There are no restrictions on which card may go where on the stacks. Once on a
stack, a card can only be moved onto a foundation.
<p>
The foundations build up in suit from Ace to King. You can only move
cards to the foundations once all cards have been placed on the
row stacks and the talon is empty.
