<h1>Cringle</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to eight piles of five cards each.  The left
four tableau piles are built down by alternate color, while
the right four tableau piles are built up by alternate color.
<p>
There are two sets of foundations.  The one on the left is built
up by suit from ace to king and the one on the right is built
down by suit from king to ace.  Each set of foundations gets one
pile of each suit.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards one at a time
from the talon and move them to the tableau or foundations.  No
redeal is allowed.  The game is won if all cards are moved to
the foundations.
