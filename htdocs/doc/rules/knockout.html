<h1>Knockout</h1>
<p>
One deck type. 1 stripped deck. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the clubs to the foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Knockout is played with a deck of only 32 cards, including the
7 through ace of each suit.
<p>
Cards are dealt three at a time from the talon to three tableau
piles.  Any clubs can be moved to the foundation.  When a card is
moved to the foundation, another card is dealt from the talon to
replace it.
<p>
After dealing five sets of cards from the talon, shuffle the
tableau piles with the remainder of the talon, to create a new
talon before continuing.  This can be done a max of twice.
<p>
The game is won if all the clubs have been moved to the foundation.
