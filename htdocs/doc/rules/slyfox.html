<h1>Sly Fox</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Twenty cards are dealt to twenty reserve piles, with an
ace and a king of each suit dealt to the foundations.  The
foundations with aces are built up by suit from ace to king,
while the ones with kings are built down from king to ace.
<p>
At the start of the game, cards from the reserve piles can be
moved to the foundation.  At this point, any cards moved to
the foundation are replaced from the talon.
<p>
Once no more cards can be moved, twenty cards are dealt from
the talon, one at a time, and can be moved to reserve piles.
Until all twenty cards have been moved (or the talon is empty)
no further cards can be moved from the reserve to the foundation.
Cards dealt from the talon may be moved directly to foundations,
but these do not count towards the twenty.
<p>
After twenty cards have been moved (or the talon is empty), cards
may be moved from the reserves to the foundations again, though
this time, empty reserves are not filled immediately.  Once no
more cards can be moved, you can deal another twenty from the talon
in the same manner as described above.  This cycle continues until
the talon is empty.
<p>
Cards cannot be moved between reserve piles at any time.  The game
is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
