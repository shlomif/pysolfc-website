<h1>Beehive</h1>
<p>
Canfield type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Six tableau piles are dealt forming the "garden", and there is a
thirteen card reserve called the "beehive".
<p>
Piles in the tableau/garden are built by the same rank.  Once all four
cards of the same rank are in a tableau pile, that pile may be moved to
the foundation.  If a tableau pile is empty, the top card from the
reserve/beehive is dealt in its place.  If the reserve is empty, any card
from the tableau or waste pile may be dealt in its place.
<p>
Cards may be dealt from the stock three at a time, and may be played on
the tableau piles.  The top card of the reserve/beehive may also be moved
to a matching tableau pile.
<p>
The game is won when all cards have been matched up and moved to the
foundation.
