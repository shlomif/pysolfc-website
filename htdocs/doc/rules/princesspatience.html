<h1>Princess Patience</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of thirty-two tableau piles,
arranged in two 4x4 grids of sixteen cards, with two
empty foundation columns placed between them.  Tableau
piles are built down by same suit, arranged so only the
top card is visible, though a card can only be moved if
it's the top card of a pile with no cards between it
and the foundation column.  Empty tableau piles can only
be filled from the waste.
<p>
Cards are dealt one at a time from the talon and can be
moved to an appropriate tableau pile or foundation.  No
redeal is allowed.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
