<h1>Triple Alliance</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all but one card to the single foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt in piles of two to three.  Cards may be removed
from the tableau in sequences of three consecutive ranks.  Turning
the corner is allowed, so ace can follow king and vice versa.
<p>
Sequences are built in a series of three free cells, and are then
moved to the foundation once the sequence is complete.  The game is
won when there is only one card left on the tableau.
