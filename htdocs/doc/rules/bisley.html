<h1>Bisley</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt in twelve piles of four cards, and the aces are
dealt to four foundation piles.  Tableau piles are built up or
down by the same suit.  Cards can be moved between tableau piles
one at a time.  Empty tableau piles can't be filled.
<p>
There are two sets of foundations - one is built up by suit
starting from the pre-dealt aces.  The other is built down by suit,
starting with kings.  Cards in foundations can't be moved.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are moved to the foundations.  It
doesn't matter how many cards are in each foundation.
