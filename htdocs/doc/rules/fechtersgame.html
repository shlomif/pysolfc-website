<h1>Fechter's Game</h1>
<p>
Spider type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in descending sequence
by alternate color from King to Ace and move such sets to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Four cards are dealt to each of twelve tableau piles, with alternating
cards face-up and face-down (the bottom and third from the bottom cards
are face-down).  Tableau piles are built down by alternate color, and
any card or valid sequence of cards can be moved between tableau piles.
Only kings or sequences of cards starting with them can fill empty piles.
<p>
The object is to group the cards in sets of 13 cards, from King to Ace
in an alternating color sequence. Such groups can be moved to the foundations.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal one card from the talon to
each tableau pile.  However, if a tableau pile has a valid alternate color
sequence at the top of it, starting with a king, that pile is skipped.  The
game is won if all cards are grouped into sequences and moved to the
foundations.
