<h1>Interment</h1>
<p>
Fan game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="newyork.html">New York</a>,
but tableau piles are built down by same suit, empty tableau piles
are immediately filled from the stock, the foundations are built up
from ace to king, and there is a five card reserve.
<p>
At the start of the game, a card is dealt to each of five reserve
piles, and thirteen more cards are dealt to a face-down stack
above.  Cards from the reserve can be moved to an appropriate
tableau or foundation pile, and are immediately replaced from
the above stack.
