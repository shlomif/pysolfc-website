<h1>Flower Arrangement</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. Two Hanafuda decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Arrange the Flower Cards in suit order.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Play is somewhat similar to <a href="picturegallery.html">Picture Gallery</a>.
The layout consists of three rows of playing piles and a row for newly
dealt cards.
<p>
The cards must be arranged from forth rank to first in the top three
rows as follows:
<ul>
<li>The first row will only accept the first four suits, Pine, Plum, Cherry and Wisteria
<li>the second row will accept the second four, Iris, Peony, Bush Clover and Eularia
<li>and the third row will accept the last four, Chrysanthemum, Maple, Willow and Paulownia.
</ul>
<p>
If you clear a space at the bottom it will be automatically filled
with a card from the talon. But if the talon is gone and you clear a space
at the bottom, then you can fill it with any card.
When no further moves are possible, click on the talon for a fresh row
of cards at the bottom.
<p>
You win when all of the suits are arranged in order.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Because of the many piles involved the Picture Gallery requires some
concentration, but it is not too hard to win.
