<h1>Colonel</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Thirty-six cards are dealt to three rows of twelve cards each.
A card is available if the pile directly below it is empty
(cards in the bottom row are always available).  Tableau piles
are built down by suit, and only single cards can be moved, but
cards can only be moved if both are available, and the card is
being moved to a higher row than it's currently in.  Empty piles
can be filled with any available card from the lower row, or the
waste.
<p>
Cards can be dealt from the talon one at a time.  Cards from the
waste can be moved onto an appropriate available card.  No redeal
is allowed.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king, and any
available card can be moved to the foundations.  The game is won if
all cards are moved to the foundations.
