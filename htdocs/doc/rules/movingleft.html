<h1>Moving Left</h1>
<p>
Klondike type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, cards are dealt to ten tableau
piles, with the first pile having one card, the second having two,
and so on.  Tableau piles are built down by alternating colors.
Cards can be moved to foundations which are built up by same suit,
starting with the aces.
<p>
If a pile in the tableau is emptied, all of the face-up cards on
the tableau pile directly to the right of it are moved to fill the
empty pile.  If there are no cards to the right of it, the tableau
pile remains empty, and can be filled with a king.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock one at a time and can be moved to
the tableau or foundations.  No redeal is allowed.  The game is
won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
