<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, seven cards are dealt to seven tableau
piles.  Cards are dealt from the talon three at a time.  For each
three cards dealt, the top one must be moved to one of the tableau
piles before three more cards can be dealt.  Moving the remaining
cards is optional.
<p>
The tableau piles can contain a max of 4 cards each.  Each tableau
pile is to be built up to total 10.  Aces equal 1 and face cards
have a value of 0.  Tens are wild and can equal any value from 0 to
10.  Once played, a card in a tableau pile cannot be moved.  The
goal of the game is to build each pile with four cards with a total
value of 10.
