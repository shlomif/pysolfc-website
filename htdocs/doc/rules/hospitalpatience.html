<h1>Hospital Patience</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon three at a time, and can be
moved to foundations.  Unlimited redeals are allowed.  There
are eight foundations, four built up by suit from ace to king,
and four built down by suit from king to ace.  The game is
won if all cards are moved to the foundations - it doesn't
matter how many cards are in each foundation.
