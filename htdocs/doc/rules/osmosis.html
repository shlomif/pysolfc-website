<h1>Osmosis</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A single card is dealt to the first foundation, and four cards are dealt
to each of four tableau rows, with only the top card visible.  No building
in this tableau is allowed.  The remaining cards are dealt three at a time
from the stock.  On this first foundation, any card of the same suit as
the first card can be played.
<p>
Lower foundations are started with a card of the same rank as the
first card.  Subsequent cards played to these foundations must be the
same suit as that first card played to it, and have a rank that matches
that of a card that's already been played to the foundation directly
above it.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
