<h1>Ashrafi</h1>
Mughal Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to
<a href="freecell.html">FreeCell</a>.
The rows build down by rank only, no more than twelve to a row.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The cards on the tableau build down by rank regardless of suit.  No more
than twelve cards may be placed in one row.  The four reserve stacks
below the foundations will hold one card each.  The foundations build
up in rank by suit starting with the Ace.  Only the Mirs (Kings) may
be played on empty rows.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Move the tableau cards with the objective of releasing the Aces first.
Keep the reserve stacks open as much as possible.  Build piles on
the Mirs so they can be moved to open rows.
