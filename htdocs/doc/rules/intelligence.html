<h1>Intelligence</h1>
<p>
Fan game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Eighteen tableau piles of three cards are dealt.  Any ace that
would be dealt is dealt to the foundation instead, and a new card
is dealt to replace it.  The remaining cards are set aside in the
talon.
<p>
Tableau piles are built up or down by same suit.  Empty tableau
piles are immediately filled with the top three cards from the talon.
Any aces are dealt to the foundations in the same way as described
above.
<p>
When there are no moves left, the tableau piles can be shuffled with the
remaining talon and redealt in the same manner as above.  This can be
done up to twice per game.
<p>
Foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.  The game is
won when all cards are moved to the foundations.
