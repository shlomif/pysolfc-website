<h1>Napoleon Takes Moscow</h1>
<p>
Napoleon type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to eight piles of four cards each.  An
additional sixteen cards are dealt in an additional pile,
containing alternating rows of one and two cards, located in
the center, between the fourth and fifth piles.
<p>
No building is allowed in this center pile, and cards can only
be moved from it if all of their covering cards are removed.
The remaining tableau piles are built down by same suit, with
only individual cards allowed to be moved between tableau piles,
and only kings can fill empty spots.
<p>
Cards can be dealt from the talon one at a time, and moved to the
tableau or foundations.  Two redeals are allowed, so you can go
through the talon three times at most.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king, and the
game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
