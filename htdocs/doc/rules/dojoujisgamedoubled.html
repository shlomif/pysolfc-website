<h1>Double Dojoujis's Game</h1>
Hanafuda game type. 4 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="larasgame.html">Lara's Game</a>
with four Hanafuda decks.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Refer to the description of the deal in Lara's Game.  The difference
is the use of four Hanafuda decks instead of two 52 card standard decks
When a first rank card is dealt to the rows two cards are dealt to the talon.
There are twelve first rank cards in a Hanafuda deck.  There are 16 rows
in this Lara's game version.  Cards are dealt to all sixteen rows based on
their rank and which deck they are from.  The four decks are shuffled together
on the talon.
<p>
The foundations take four complete rounds of a suit.  After the last card
of the first round is played to a foundation the first card of the second
round will play.
