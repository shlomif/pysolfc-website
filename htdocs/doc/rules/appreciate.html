<h1>Appreciate</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Just like <a href="one234.html">One234</a>,
but you can build in the tableau, down by rank, regardless of suit,
turning the corner from ace to king as needed.  The first two piles
are built down by 1, the second two are built down by 2, the third
two are built down by 3, and the last two are built down by 4.
<p>
Empty piles can be filled by a card that's the same rank as the final
card that would be played to the foundation built up by the same amount.
