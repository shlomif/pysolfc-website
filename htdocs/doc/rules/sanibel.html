<h1>Sanibel</h1>
<p>
Yukon / Forty Thieves hybrid. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.
Cards in the Foundations are no longer available for play in
the Tableau. It is not compulsory to play any card to the Foundations.
<p>
The Tableau is built down by alternate color. Any group of cards may be
moved regardless of sequence, so long as the bottom card of the group is
placed on top of a card (in a different pile) that is the next higher card in
rank and of the opposite color.  An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled
with any group of cards, even a single card.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
<i>From John Stoneham, Sanibel's inventor:</i>
<p>
Sanibel and Captiva are islands off the coast of Ft. Meyers, Florida. One
summer while vacationing there, I played through all the games described in
<i>The Complete Book of Solitaire & Patience Games</i> by Albert H. Morehead
and Geoffrey Mott-Smith (published by Bantam, I believe). I really liked the
play of <a href="yukon.html">Yukon</a> but thought the Tableau limited the
strategic potential of the game, so I added an extra deck and experimented with
the Tableau layout, aiming for a game that was almost entirely strategic in
nature but not on the 10th order of mental magnitude. The result is Sanibel. The
number of face-up cards initially dealt to the Tableau determines how much "luck"
will play a factor in the game. If you only deal 3 or 4 face-up cards to each
pile retaining the balance in the Reserve, chances are you will loose some games.
Technically, there is nothing wrong with that, and sometimes I will play it
this way. On the other hand, dealing every card face up (except the last 4)
takes away nothing from the game and only serves to increase the strategy
involved. I prefer the 3-down-7-up layout, since the face down cards and the
small Reserve give you something immediate to work for, and it can generate a
little suspense when you know there is a card buried that you need and you're
trying to find a way to uncover it...

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
This is entirely a game of skill: if you lose, you just weren't paying
attention. Your first priority should be to expose all the face-down cards and
get the rest of the Reserve into play. Also, do not play a card onto a
Foundation simply because you can (Aces are OK; Twos are probably safe as
well): you may need it for building in the Tableau. You will find that you do
not need to calculate very long sequences to finish the game, but sometimes a
bit of calculation is necessary to expose the buried cards. Sometimes the piles
can grow longer than can be displayed in the window. This usually isn't a
problem, since you can break up the pile fairly often when other plays
become available. Here's something that's a lot of fun: If you have arranged
the cards in proper sequence, playing as few to the Foundations as possible
during the game, one press of the "Auto" button can play 90 or more cards to
the Foundations. It is possible to have every card in the Tableau at the end
of the game, even the Aces; the "Auto" button shoots them all up to the
Foundations in one long riffle!
