<h1>Patriarchs</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Patriarchs is a solitaire card game which is played with two decks of playing
cards. It is similar in reserve layout to <a href="oddandeven.html">Odd and
Even</a> but with different game play.
<p>
First, one king and one ace are removed from the deck and placed in two
columns: one with all aces and the other with all kings. In between these two
columns is a space for the reserve, which is composed of nine cards arranged
in three rows of three cards each.
<p>
Ace and King columns are the foundations. The ace foundations are built up to
Kings while the king foundations are built down to aces, all by suit. When the
top cards of the ace and king foundations of the same suit are in sequence, a
reversal can be done, i.e. cards can be moved one at a time from one
foundation to the other, except the base aces and kings.
<p>
The nine reserve cards are available for play on the foundations (not on each
other). When a card leaves the reserve, the space it leaves behind is filled
with the top card of the waste pile (or the stock if there is no waste pile
yet).
<p>
If play comes to a standstill in the reserve, the stock is dealt one card at a
time, and if a card is unplayable, it is placed on the waste pile, the top
card of which is available for building on the foundations or filling a space
on the reserve. Only one redeal is allowed; to do this the unused cards in the
waste pile is picked up and turned face down to be used as the new stock.
<p>
The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations.

<h3>Picture Patience</h3>
<p>
Picture Patience is a solitaire game which is played exactly like Patriarchs
except for the following:
<ul>
<li>At the onset, no card is placed in the foundations; aces and kings needed
are mixed in the deck.
<li>Reversals are not allowed.
<li>SolSuite's version of the game allows one redeal while Pretty Good
Solitaire's version doesn't allow any redeal.
</ul>
