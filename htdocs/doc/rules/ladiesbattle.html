<h1>Ladies Battle</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
All of the queens are dealt to four foundation piles on the
right, while the jacks are dealt to four reserve piles on the
left.  A card is dealt to each of six tableau piles.  The tableau
piles are built down by alternate color, turning the corner from
ace to king as necessary, and only single cards can be moved
between tableau piles.  Empty tableau piles are immediately filled
from talon.  Once the talon is empty, they can be filled with any
card.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal one card from the talon
to each tableau pile.  The foundations are built up from queen to
jack, turning the corner from king to ace.  The jacks in the reserve
can only be moved to the foundations.  The game is won if all cards
are moved to the foundations.
