<h1>Matrix</h1>
Matrix type. One deck. No redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Restore game pieces to their proper order.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The pieces are dealt to a grid, based on the size of the matrix, with a single
blank space left.  Pieces may not be lifted from the canvas.  They may be moved
by clicking on a piece which is in either the row or the column which has the
empty spot.  That piece and all intervening pieces will move one space towards
the empty spot.
<p>
Matrix games can be played with a sequential numbered cardset (Matrix), or with
a picture puzzle cardset (Picture Matrix).  With the sequential cardset, your
goal is to organize the cards in sequence, left to right, top to bottom.  With
a picture puzzle cardset, your goal is to assemble the picture correctly.
<p>
When all the pieces have been restored to their correct order, with the blank space
in the bottom right corner, the final piece will be dealt to the tableau and the
game has been won.  Every Matrix game can be solved.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Begin in the upper left hand corner and complete one row before starting the next.
