<h1>Indian Patience</h1>
<p>
Forty Thieves type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="fortythieves.html">Forty Thieves</a>,
but the tableau is dealt in ten piles of three cards
each, with the bottom card of each pile face-down, and
the piles build down by any suit but own.
<p>
Additionally, if there is a tableau pile with only a
single card left in it while there are still cards in the
talon, that tableau card can't be moved to another tableau
pile, and no cards can be moved on top of it.  Single cards
can only be moved to the foundation, and once a pile is
empty, three additional cards are dealt from the talon to
fill the pile (with the bottom one face-down, like the
initial deal).  Once the talon has been emptied, single
card tableau piles can be played normally.
<p>
This is a more difficult variant of <a href="indian.html">Indian</a>.
