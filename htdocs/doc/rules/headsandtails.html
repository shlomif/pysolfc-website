<h1>Heads and Tails</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A row of eight cards is dealt to a tableau.  This is called the
"heads" row.  Below this, a row of eight piles of eleven cards is
dealt as a reserve face-down.  Below the reserve, a second row of
eight cards is dealt to a second tableau row, called the "tails"
row.
<p>
Cards in the heads row are built up by same suit, while cards in
the tails row are built down by same suit.  Empty piles are
immediately filled with the reserve pile directly above or below
that pile.  If that reserve pile is empty, they can be filled by
any card.  Cards cannot be moved from the reserves at any other
time.
<p>
One set of foundations is built up by same suit from ace to king,
and a second is built down by same suit from king to ace.  Each
set of foundations gets one sequence for each suit.  The game is
won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
