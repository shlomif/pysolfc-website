<h1>Gloria</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The cards are dealt to 24 piles of four cards each, with
the kings dealt to the foundations.  No building is allowed
on the tableau.  The foundations with the kings are built down
by same suit, while a second set is built up from ace.
<p>
There are two free cells that cards from the tableau can be moved
to, but cards in these free cells can only be moved to the
foundations.  The game is won if all cards are moved to the
foundations, though it doesn't matter how many cards are in each
foundation.
