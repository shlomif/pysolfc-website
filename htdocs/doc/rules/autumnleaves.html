<h1>Autumn Leaves</h1>
<p>
Spider type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in descending sequence
by suit from King to Ace.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
22 cards are dealt in six columns.  The tableau piles are built down
by suit, but a card may be placed on any card of the same suit but a
higher rank, even if the ranks are not consecutive.  However, a
group of cards can only be moved as a sequence if the ranks are
consecutive.
<p>
Any card or sequence can fill empty spaces.
<p>
When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card will be
added to each of the playing piles.
<p>
The game is won when all the cards are dealt into four sequences of
the same suit, descending from King to Ace.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Autumn Leaves was invented by Toby Ord, and the name comes from how
the cards can flutter between the stacks.  More details can be found
on <a href="http://www.amirrorclear.net/flowers/game/autumn-leaves/index.html">his website</a>.
