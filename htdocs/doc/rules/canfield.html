<h1>Canfield</h1>
<p>
Canfield type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Canfield is played with one deck. The object is to build all four
of the foundations at the top right from the rank of the first card
dealt into there (varies from game to game), all in the same suit.
<p>
The tableau consists of four piles, starting with one card each.  The
cards can be stacked according to the following rules
<ul>
<li> Red cards may be only played on black cards, and black only on
  red.
<li> Only the next smaller card may be played, so that the stacks
  are in descending sequence except when the previous card is an Ace,
  in which only the King may be played.
<li> You may not move parts of a sequence except the top card.
<li> Empty spaces in the tableau will be filled automatically from
  the reserve (the pile below the talon) until it is exhausted.  When
  the reserve is exhausted, the empty spaces can be filled with any
  card.
</ul>
<p>
When there are no more possible moves, click on the talon.  Three
cards will be moved from the talon to the waste pile directly to its
right.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The auto-solver is hopeless.  Don't believe the hints.  They tend to
be right but it doesn't figure everything out (there may be valid
moves that it won't guess).
