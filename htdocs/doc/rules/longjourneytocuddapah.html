<h1>Long Journey to Cuddapah</h1>
Braid type. Two decks. Two redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.
<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="braid.html">Braid</a>
played with two Dashavatara
<a href="../ganjifa.html">Ganjifa</a>
decks.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Braid.  In this variation there are two Braid
stacks that each have their own set of Braid reserve stacks.  The
game lay out starts with the twenty foundations in the outer most columns.
The next two columns inwards are the ten Braid reserves.  Then there
are two columns with five general reserves each.  The inner most two
columns are the two Braid stacks.  Each Braid starts with twenty cards.
When one of the Braid reserves becomes open the card at the top of the
corresponding Braid will be moved there.  When all the cards from one
of the Braids are removed a card from the other Braid will be used.
<p>
Cuddapah is a city in India with a history in the production of Ganjifa cards.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
Build sequences on the rows that will play when the correct card turns
over from the talon.  This game type requires careful strategy to win.
