<h1>Alternation</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Alternation is a solitaire card game which is played using two decks of
playing cards. Its tableau (or playing area) is similar to that of another
solitaire game <i>Stonewall</i>.
<p>
Forty-nine cards are set up into seven columns of seven cards each. Keep in
mind that in each column, the top card, as well as the third, fifth cards from
the top and the bottom card, are face up, while the second, fourth, and sixth
cards from the top are face down, much like the pattern OXOXOXO.
<p>
The object of the game is to release the Aces as they become available and
built each of them by suit.
<p>
The top cards of each column are the only ones available for play, to be built
up by suit on the foundations, or on each other down by alternating colors. A
sequence or part of a sequence can be moved as a unit.
<p>
When no more cards can be moved, the stock (the remaining cards) is dealt one
card at a time. A card that cannot be built on the tableau or on the
foundations is placed on the waste pile, the top card of which is available
for play.
<p>
The game ends soon after the entire stock has run out. The game is won when
all cards are built onto the foundations.
