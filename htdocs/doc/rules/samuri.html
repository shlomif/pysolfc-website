<h1>Samuri</h1>
<p>
Hanafuda type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Samuri is a <a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a> type game.  Play begins with a similar layout.
There are seven row stacks with six foundations to either side.  The
Talon is in the middle.  Cards are dealt from the talon to the waste
stack one at a time.  There is only one round.  The cards play on the
foundations from fourth rank to first by suits.  They play on the rows
from first to fourth, also by suits.  Rank order is strict for all suits.
Only first rank cards will play on the canvas.  Cards cannot be removed
from a foundation once played there.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Hint: try not to let the waste stack get too deep.
