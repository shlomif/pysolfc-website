<h1>Racing Aces</h1>
<p>
Three-Deck game type. 3 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Racing Aces is a three deck variation of
<a href="acesandkings.html">Aces and Kings</a>.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
There are four sets of four foundations.  The first set is built up
from ace to king, the second set is built down from king to ace, the
third set is built up from seven to king, and the last set is built
down from six to ace.
<p>
There are three thirteen card reserves, along with six tableau piles.
The topmost card of the reserve may be moved to any appropriate
foundation, as may any of the tableau cards.  No building is allowed
on the tableau, and if a tableau card is moved, it is replaced from
the top of the talon.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time.  No redeal is allowed.
When the talon is empty, any card can be moved to an empty tableau
pile.
