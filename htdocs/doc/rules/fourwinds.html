<h1>Four Winds</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The aces are dealt to the foundations, with the two aces of
each suit on a different side of the talon.  Four cards are
dealt to free cells next to each of the foundations.
<p>
Cards are dealt one at a time from the talon.  Cards in the
talon can be moved to free cells or foundations.  After the
initial cards are moved, only cards of the same suit as the
adjacent foundation can be moved back to those cells.  Only
one redeal is allowed.
<p>
Foundations are built up by the same suit.  The game is won
if all cards are moved to the foundations.
