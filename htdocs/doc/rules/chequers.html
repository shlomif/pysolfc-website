<h1>Chequers</h1>
<p>
Beleaguered Castle type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to 25 piles of four cards each.  Tableau
piles are built up or down by same suit, and only single
cards can be moved between tableau piles.  Empty piles
are immediately filled with one of the four remaining cards
from the talon, and can be filled with any single card
once the talon is empty.
<p>
There are two sets of foundations.  One is built up by
same suit from ace to king, while the other is built
down by suit from king to ace.  The game is won if all
cards are moved to the foundations.
