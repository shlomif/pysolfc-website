<h1>Take Away</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all of the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The cards are dealt into four tableau stacks of 13 face-up cards each.
Cards may be moved to one of the six foundations one at a time.  Any
card may be used to start one of the foundations, but after that, the
foundations are built in sequence up or down in rank.  Turning the
corner is allowed, so aces may be played on kings, and vice versa.
<p>
You may not move cards between tableau stacks.
<p>
You win if you get all the cards to the foundations.
