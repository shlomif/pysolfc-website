<h1>Wake-Robin</h1>
<p>
Spider type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Arrange all cards in columns with complete sequences from king to ace.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="trillium.html">Trillium</a>,
but with only nine piles, and the tableau is built down by rank,
regardless of suit.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to nine piles of four cards each, with alternating
cards face-up and face-down.  Tableau piles are built down by rank, regardless
of suit, and any card or sequence of cards can be moved between piles.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal one card from the top of the
talon to each tableau pile.  The game is won if you're able to organize
all the cards into complete sequences from king to ace.
