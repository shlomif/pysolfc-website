<h1>Beacon</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to eight piles of four cards each.
Tableau piles are built down by rank, regardless of
suit, turning the corner from ace to king as necessary.
Any card or valid sequence of cards can be moved between
tableau piles.  If a tableau pile is empty, a single card
is dealt from the talon to that pile.  If the talon is
empty, any card or sequence can be moved to fill empty
piles.
<p>
The foundation is built up by rank, regardless of suit,
turning the corner from king to ace as necessary.  Any
card can be used to start the foundation, and the game
is won when all cards are moved to the foundation.
