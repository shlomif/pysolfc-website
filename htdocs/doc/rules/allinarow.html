<h3>History</h3>
<p>
This version of All in a Row is a <a href="blackhole.html">Black Hole</a>
variant that is actually a misinterpretation of the original game's rules.
This variant is also known as Quasar to better distinguish it from the
original game.  In PySol, the original game can be found as
