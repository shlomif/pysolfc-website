The rows build down by rank in the same suit.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The cards on the tableau build down by ranks of the same suit.  The
foundations build up in rank by suit starting with the Ace.  Any
card or movable pile may be played on an empty row.  Cards are dealt
from the talon one at a time.  There is no limit on the number of
redeals.  Cards may be played from the foundations.
<p>
This game is one of a series of games that have names ending in "pati"
which transliterates as "lord of".  Ashwapati means "Lord of Horses".
The names are the names of the suits in a twelve suit Ganjifa deck.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Move cards off of the deepest stacks first.
