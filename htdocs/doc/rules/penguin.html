<h1>Penguin</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The top left card is called the <i>Beak</i> and determines the base
rank for the foundations. The three other cards of the same rank
are placed to the foundations.
<p>
The seven piles build down by same suit, wrapping around from Ace to King.
Empty spaces may only be filled by a card or a sequence
one below the Beak's rank.
<p>
The seven free cells (also called the <i>Flipper</i>) can hold
any - and just one - card.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Penguin was invented by David Parlett, and the original rules can be found

It is also known as Beak and Flipper.
