<h1>Doorway</h1>
<p>
Klondike type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of five tableau piles.  Tableau
piles are built down by rank, regardless of suit.  Only
single cards can be moved between tableau piles, and any
card can fill an empty pile.  The foundations are built up
by same suit from ace to king.
<p>
There are two reserve piles.  One can only contain a single
king and the other can only contain a single queen.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the
talon one at a time, and move them to a tableau, foundation,
or reserve.  No redeals are allowed.  The game is won if all
cards are moved to the foundations.
