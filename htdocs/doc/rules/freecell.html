<h1>FreeCell</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
FreeCell is played with one deck. All cards are dealt at the start of the
game. To compensate for this there are 4 free cells which can hold
any - and just one - card.
<p>
Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space can be filled
with any card or sequence.
<p>
The number of cards you can move as a sequence is restricted by
the number of free cells - the number of free cells required is the
same as if you would make an equivalent sequence of moves with single cards.
(As a shortcut, the computer also considers the number of free piles so
that you can move even more cards as one single sequence.)

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Game numbers in the range 1 to 32000 are compatible to the ones in the
