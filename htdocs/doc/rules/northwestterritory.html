<h1>Northwest Territory</h1>
<p>
Raglan type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to eight tableau piles, each with one more
card than the previous one (the first has one card, the second
has two, up to the last one with eight).  Only the top card of
each pile is face-up.  The remaining cards are dealt out to
sixteen reserves.
<p>
The tableau is built down by alternate color.  Any card or valid
sequence of cards can be moved between tableau piles.  Cards from
the reserve can be moved to the tableau or foundation, but
cards cannot be moved to the reserves.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.  The
game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
