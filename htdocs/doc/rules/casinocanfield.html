<h1>Casino Canfield</h1>
<p>
Canfield type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Just like <a href="canfield.html">Canfield</a>,
but cards are dealt from the talon one at a time,
and there is no redeal.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
There is a simple casino scoring system here - you debit $52 for each game
and for every card you bear off, you get $5 credit.
Your balance is reset whenever you select a different game.
Loaded games and manually entered game numbers don't count.
<p>
Casino Canfield is an attempt to recreate the game played in
Richard A. Canfield's casino, though it is possible that the game in
question is actually <a href="vegasklondike.html">a variation of Klondike</a>.
