<h1>Jane</h1>
<p>
Raglan type. 1 deck. No redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Groups of cards can
be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a card whose rank is
one lower than the base card or with a group of cards starting with a card
with this rank.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the Stock to the Reserve. Each deal places one card on
each pile of the Reserve.
<p>
The top card of each Reserve pile is always available for play on to either
the Tableau or the Foundation. There is no building on the Reserve piles.
<p>
Foundations are built up in suit from the base card. New Foundations are
started when a card of the same rank as the first card placed during the
dealing period are placed on empty Foundation piles. Aces are placed on Kings,
and twos on Aces. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a
card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is
possible.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
The deeper something is, the harder it is to get to. Try and move cards out of
the Reserve whenever possible.
