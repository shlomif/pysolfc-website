<h1>Exit</h1>
<p>
Pairing type. 1 deck. No redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt in ten columns of five cards, plus one column of two.
<p>
Pairs of exposed number cards can be removed if they total up to 11.
Jacks are removed in pairs.  A queen can be removed if it is paired
off with a king, but not if they are of the same suit.  Removed cards
are moved to a single foundation, and the game is won if all cards
are paired off.
