<h1>Wave Motion</h1>
<p>
One-deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the tableau, in four columns with complete sequences from
king to ace.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The cards are dealt into eight reserve stacks, and the top card of any of
these stacks may be moved to one of eight tableau stacks, one at a time.
Cards may not be moved between the reserve stacks.
<p>
The tableau stacks are built down by suit.  Any sequence of cards in the
tableau stacks may be moved to another appropriate tableau stack.  The game
is won when four stacks contain complete sequences from king to ace.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Wave Motion was invented by David Bernazzani.  Its name is a reference to
the anime series Space Battleship Yamato, also called Star Blazers.
