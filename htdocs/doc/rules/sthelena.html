<h1>St. Helena</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A king of each suit is dealt to a row of four foundations.
An ace of each suit is similarly dealt to a second row of
foundations below the first.  There are twelve tableau piles
dealt in a circle around the foundations, with four above the
first row of foundations, four below the bottom row, and two on
each side.  The remaining cards are dealt evenly to these
foundations, starting from the pile above the leftmost king.
<p>
Tableau piles are built up or down by rank, regardless of
suit, with only the top card visible of each, and only single
cards can be moved between piles.  Empty tableau piles can't be
filled.
<p>
The foundations with kings are built down by same suit, while the
foundations with aces are built up by same suit.  Only cards from
the top six piles can be moved to the top row of foundations, and
only cards from the bottom six piles can be moved to the bottom
row of foundations.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can combine the tableau piles,
starting with the last pile dealt.  Then, without shuffling, they
are redealt in the same manner.  After the first redeal, the
restrictions as to which cards can be dealt to which foundation
no longer apply.  Two redeals are allowed.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are moved to the foundations.
