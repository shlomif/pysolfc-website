<h1>Ace of Hearts</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to seven piles, with an ascending number of cards
in each pile (1 in the first, 2 in the second, etc.), all face-up.
<p>
Build the tableau piles down by same suit.  Any group of cards can
be moved, regardless of sequence.  Only a king or a group of cards
starting with a king can be moved to an empty pile.  When there
are no moves left, you can deal a card from the talon to each pile.
<p>
The single foundation is started with the ace of hearts.  After the
ace of hearts is played, it is built up by rank, regardless of suit,
turning the corner from king to ace as needed.  The game is won if
all cards are moved to this one foundation.
