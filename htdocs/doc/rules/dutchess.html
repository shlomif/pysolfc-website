<h1>Dutchess</h1>
<p>
Canfield type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of four tableau piles.  Three cards are
dealt to each of four reserve piles.  At the start of the game, one
card from the top of the reserve must be moved to a foundation pile.
This card is used as the base rank for the foundations.  No other
cards can be moved until this is done.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by alternate color, wrapping from ace to
king as necessary.  Empty tableau piles can only be filled by the top
card from one of the reserve piles.  If the reserves are empty, any card
or sequence can fill the empty piles.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock one at a time and can be moved to the
tableau or foundations.  You can only flip the deck and go through the
deck once.
<p>
The foundation piles are built up by suit, starting from the base rank
you set above, turning the corner from king to ace as necessary.  The
game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Dutchess is a Canfield variation that was invented by Albert Morehead
and Geoffrey Mott-Smith.  It also goes by the name Glenwood.
