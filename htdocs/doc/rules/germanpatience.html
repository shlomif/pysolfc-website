<h1>German Patience</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the tableau in eight piles of thirteen
cards.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of eight tableau piles.  Tableau piles
are built up by rank, regardless of suit, turning the corner from
king to ace as necessary.  Only single cards can be moved between
tableau piles, and empty piles can be filled by any card.  A max
of 13 cards is allowed in each tableau pile.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock one at a time, and can be moved to
appropriate tableau piles.  No redeal is allowed.  The game is won
if you manage to get all the cards to the tableau, forming eight
piles of thirteen cards.
