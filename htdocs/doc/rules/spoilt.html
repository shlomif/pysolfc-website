<h1>Spoilt</h1>
<p>
Montana type. 1 stripped deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 8 cards in ascending sequence
by suit from Seven to King.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Spoilt is played with a deck of only 32 cards, including the 7 through
ace of each suit.
<p>
Seven cards are dealt into a layout of four rows, and the remaining four cards
are set aside to form the stock.  A card is dealt in the stock, and may be
played in its correct position in the layout, depending on its rank.  Eights go in
the leftmost column, with aces on the far right, and the remaining cards in
sequence.  Sevens are played in a column to the left of the main layout.
<p>
The card in that position is then turned up and may be likewise moved to its
correct position.  If a seven was played, draw a new card from the stock to play.
<p>
Sequences follow suit, so once a single card is played in a row, the remaining
cards of that suit go in the same row.
<p>
The game continues until all four sevens are played.  The game is won if all four
sequences are completed.
