<h1>Perseverance</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Perseverance is a solitaire card game played with a deck of 52 playing cards.
The reason is not known for the name is not known, but probably, the player
must play this game with perseverance to succeed.
<p>
First, the four aces are taken out of the deck. These form the four
foundations.
<p>
Then the rest are shuffled and dealt into twelve piles of four cards each. One
can distribute one card at a time for each pile or deal four cards at a time
to form a pile.
<p>
The top cards of each pile are available for play to the foundations or on the
tableau piles. The foundations are built up by suit, with the cards on the
tableau are built down, also by suit.
<p>
One card can be moved at a time. However, the player is allowed to move a
sequence of cards as a unit to another pile with an appropriate card (e.g.
6-5-4-3 of spades can be placed on the 7 of spades).
<p>
When all possible moves are made (or the player has done all the possible
moves one can make), the piles are picked up in reverse order. For example,
the twelfth pile is placed over the eleventh pile, and this new pile is placed
on the tenth pile, and so on. Then, without shuffling, the cards are dealt to
as many piles of four as the remaining decks will allow. To ensure that the
order of the cards is not disturbed for the most part, it is suggested that
the cards are dealt four at time. This can be done only twice.
<p>
The game is won successfully when all cards are built onto the foundations up
to Kings.
