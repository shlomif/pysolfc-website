<h1>Eagle Wing</h1>
<p>
Canfield type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Eight cards are dealt to eight tableau piles, positioned to resemble
a bird's wings.  In the middle, thirteen cards are dealt to a reserve
face-down.  Tableau piles are built down by same suit, wrapping from ace
to king as needed, though a max of three cards can be in each tableau
pile.  Only single cards can be moved between tableau piles, and empty
tableau piles are filled immediately from the top card of the reserve.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time, and can be moved to the
tableau or foundation.  Two redeals are allowed.
<p>
At the start of the game, one card is dealt to the foundations.  The
foundations are built up by suit, starting from the rank of that first
dealt card, wrapping from king to ace as necessary.  The game is won
if all cards are moved to the foundations.
