<h1>Baker's Game</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="freecell.html">FreeCell</a>,
but the piles build down by suit.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
All cards are dealt at the start of the game. To compensate for this
there are 4 free cells which can hold any - and just one - card.
<p>
Cards may only be moved onto cards of the same suit.
<p>
The number of cards you can move as a sequence is restricted by
the number of free cells - the number of free cells required is the
same as if you would make an equivalent sequence of moves with single cards.
(As a shortcut, the computer also considers the number of free piles so
that you can move even more cards as one single sequence.)

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
<i>Baker's Game</i> is named after the mathematician C.L. Baker
and was first published in Martin Gardner's June 1968
<i>Mathematical Games</i> column in <i>Scientific American</i>.
