<h1>Ricochet</h1>
<p>
Golf type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Remove all cards from the tableau.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tableau piles are built in four pyramid-esque "walls", with each
wall having four cards in the top layer, three in the middle, and two
in the bottom.  One wall is facing in each direction, and the cards
on the edge of the top layer are shared between the adjoining walls.
The tableau and foundation are placed in the center of the four
walls.
<p>
Cards can be dealt from the tableau one at a time.  Exposed cards from
the walls can be moved from the tableau if they are one rank higher or
lower than the card currently on the foundation.  Turning the corner is
allowed, so kings can be played on aces, and vice versa.  After a card
is played, the next card cannot be played from the same wall.  The cards
in the corners are treated as part of both walls they overlap.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are removed from the tableau.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Ricochet was invented by Bram Tebbutt.  More details can be found on
