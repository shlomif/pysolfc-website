<h1>Union Square</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards in tableau can be built either up or down in suit. However, each pile must follow only one of
these rules. For example, if a tableau pile has a three of clubs over a two of clubs, one can only
play a four of clubs on this pile. Any available card can be played on to an empty tableau pile.
<p>
Foundation piles are to be built in suit from Ace to King, followed by another King, then back down
to Ace, giving 26 cards per pile when game is won. Cards in foundation piles are no longer in play.
<p>
Cards can be flipped singly from the talon to the waste.
Top card of waste is available for play.
There is no redeal.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
A string of beads can be added to from both ends, and so should your piles.
Make good use of any empty slots to append cards.
With a little perseverance, this game can be a lot of fun!
