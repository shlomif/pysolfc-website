<h1>Hit or Miss</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. Varying number of redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>As you draw cards from the talon, one at a time, declare a card rank
in sequence (ace to king, then start over from ace).  If the drawn card
matches the declard rank, that is a "Hit", and the card may be moved to
the foundation.  Otherwise, it is a "Miss".  You can continue to redeal
as many times as you need, until you go through the entire deck twice in
a row without getting a single "Hit".

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
For a variation that allows unlimited redeals (often seen in other
solitaire apps), see <a href="hitormissunlimited.html">Hit or Miss Unlimited</a>.
