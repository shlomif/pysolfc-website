<h1>Dashavatara</h1>
<p>
One Dashavatara Ganjifa deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Arrange the Ten Avatars in order.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Play is similar to <a href="picturegallery.html">Picture Gallery</a>.
The layout consists of three rows of playing piles, a row for newly
dealt cards and three free cells that will hold one card each.
<p>
The cards must be arranged in the top three rows as follows:
<ul>
<li>The top row must start with a three and build by suit in increments of three,
<li>the second row must with a two,
<li>and the third row must start with an Ace.
</ul>
<p>
If you clear a space at the bottom it will be automatically filled
with a card from the talon. But if the talon is gone and you clear a space
at the bottom, then you can fill it with any card.  You may move any card
to the free cells from the tableau on top or the rows below, but only as
long as there are cards left in the talon.  When the talon is empty, you
may only move cards from, not to the free cells.
When no further moves are possible, click on the talon for a fresh row
of cards at the bottom.
<p>
You win when all of the suits are arranged in order.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Because of the many piles involved the Picture Gallery requires some
concentration, but it is not too hard to win.
