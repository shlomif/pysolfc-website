<h1>Octave</h1>
<p>
Forty Thieves type. 2 decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to eight piles of three cards, and the aces
are dealt to the foundations.  Tableau piles are built down
by alternate colors, and only single cards can be moved
between tableau piles.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time and can be moved
to foundation or tableau piles.  When the talon is empty, it can
be flipped for a second deal.  During this second round, eight cards
are dealt from the talon to eight waste piles, and a new card is
dealt to fill empty piles from these waste piles.

Foundations are built up by same suit, and the game is won
when all cards are moved to the foundation.
