<h1>Katrina's Game</h1>
Tarock game type. 2 decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="larasgame.html">Lara's Game</a>
with twenty two rows and one redeal, using the Tarock deck.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Refer to the description of the deal in Lara's Game.  The differences
are that the cards are dealt to twenty three piles instead of fourteen
and if a dealt card is of rank Page or over one card is dealt to the
talon.  Otherwise the dealing rules are the same.
<p>
Play is the same as Lara's Game except that there is one redeal.  When
the talon is empty after the first round the cards are gathered up from
the tableau and dealt to the rows without being shuffled using the same
dealing rules as in the first round.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
If row two cards will play on the same foundation pick the card that is on
the row that holds the most cards.  Move cards from one set of foundations
to the other to get extra plays.
