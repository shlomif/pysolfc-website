<h1>Lara's Game</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to 14 piles.  The piles are organized Ace through
five, six through ten, and then the three face cards, followed by the
Talon.  [Yes, cards are dealt to the talon!]  The rules for this deal
are as follows:
<p>
Cards are dealt to the first thirteen piles in order, until the 104
cards have been used up.  If the dealt card matches the place of the
pile it is placed on, one card is dealt to the talon.  If the card is
a face card, one card is dealt to the talon.  If the card is an Ace,
two cards are dealt to the talon.  Each time the deal reaches the King
pile, two cards are dealt to the talon and the deal starts over at the
Ace pile.
<p>
The four top foundations build up from Ace, while the left four
Foundations build down from King.  Only the top card of any stack is
playable, and the rest of the cards are hidden.
<p>
The piles at the bottom of the screen represent the player's hand.
Whenever a card is dealt from the talon, the player picks up the
corresponding pile, places the dealt card at the bottom of the hand
plays any cards that can be played, and replaces the hand to the pile
that was picked up.
<p>
There is no redeal.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
This game was taught to me by a wonderful woman.  Neither she nor I
knows where the game originated (it was taught to her by her older
sister).  This game is dedicated to her.  Note: it was taught to her
by her *other* older sister.  So it really shouldn't be called Lara's
game.  But that's what I'm used to calling it, so thus it remains.
