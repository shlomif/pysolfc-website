<h1>German Clock (Die Uhr)</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>The foundations are dealt in a circle of twelve piles, similar to the
twelve numbers on a clock, with a thirteenth pile placed in the middle.
Each pile represents cards of the number in that position on a clock,
with Jacks in the 11 o'clock pile and queens in the 12 o'clock pile.
Kings go in the middle.
<p>
Deal cards from the stock one at a time.  Cards can be moved from the
waste pile to the appropriate foundation as mentioned above.  Foundations
must be built up by alternate colors, and all of the foundations must be
built up using the same sequence of suits.  One redeal is allowed.  The
game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
German Clock is more commonly known as The Clock.  It is not to be
confused with <a href="clock.html">another game by that same name.</a>
