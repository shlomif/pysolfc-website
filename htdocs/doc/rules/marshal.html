<h1>Marshal</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A single card is dealt to each of twenty-four tableau piles.
Tableau piles are built up or down by same suit, cards placed
so only the top one is visible.  Empty tableau piles are
immediately filled from the stock.  If the stock is empty,
tableau piles can't be filled.
<p>
If there are no moves left, you can deal one card from the
stock to all 24 piles.
<p>
There are two sets of foundations - the set on the left builds
up by same suit from ace to king while the set on the right
builds down by same suit from king to ace.  Cards can be moved
between foundations.  The game is won if all cards are moved
to the foundations.
