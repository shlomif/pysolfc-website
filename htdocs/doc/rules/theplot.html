<h1>The Plot</h1>
<p>
Canfield type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of twelve tableau piles, and thirteen
cards are dealt to a reserve pile.  The tableau is built down by
rank, regardless of suit, turning the corner from ace to king as
necessary, and only single cards can be moved between tableau piles.
Empty tableau piles can only be filled from the waste pile.
<p>
The foundation is built up by rank, regardless of suit, turning the
corner from king to ace as necessary.  A single card is dealt to the
leftmost foundation pile at the start of the game, and this determines
the base rank for all the foundations.  Until the first foundation is
filled with a full sequence of 13 cards, no cards can be moved to any
of the remaining seven foundations, and you can only fill empty tableau
piles with cards with the same rank as the foundation base rank.
<p>
Cards from the reserve can only be moved to an appropriate foundation pile.
If there are no moves left, deal cards from the talon one at a time.  No
redeal is allowed - you can only go through the deck once.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
