<h1>Surukh</h1>
Dashavatara Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.
<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.
<h3>Quick description</h3>
The cards build down by rank in alternating force on the tableau, no more
than twelve to a row.  Only the Rajas may be played on an empty row.
<h3>Rules</h3>
All cards are dealt to the sixteen rows when the games begins.  Cards
on the tableau build down in rank in alternating force.  See the general
<a href="../ganjifa.html">Ganjifa</a>
rules for more information.  The easy way to remember the force of a suit
is that the foundations to the left are one force and the foundations to the
right are the other.  The foundations build up by suit.  Any card or sequence
may be played on an empty row.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
Try for an empty row.
