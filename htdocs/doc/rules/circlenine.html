<h1>Circle Nine</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A single card is dealt to a foundation, and nine cards are
dealt to tableau piles in a circle around the foundation.
The foundation is built up by rank, regardless of suit, turning
the corner from king to ace as necessary.
<p>
Cards can be dealt from the talon one at a time, and moved
to the foundation or tableau piles.  Any card can be moved to
the tableau, regardless of rank, but once a card is moved to
the tableau, it can only be moved to the foundation.
<p>
The game is won if all the cards can be moved to the foundation
in a single sequence.
