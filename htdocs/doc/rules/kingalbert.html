<h3>Object</h3>

Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>

Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Empty Tableau slots
can be filled by any card or build of cards.
<p>
Cards in the Reserve can be played on to the Tableau or the Foundation. Empty
Reserve piles cannot be filled.
<p>
