<h1>Double Kali's Game</h1>
Dashavatara Ganjifa game type. 2 decks. 3 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="larasgame.html">Lara's Game</a>
with twelve rows, three redeals and a reserve stack.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Refer to the description of the deal in Lara's Game.  The differences
are that the cards are dealt to thirteen piles instead of fourteen
and if a dealt card is of rank Pradhan or over one card is dealt to the
talon.  Only one 120 card Dashavatara deck is used.  Otherwise the
dealing rules are the same.
<p>
Play is the same as Lara's Game except that there are three redeals.  When
the talon is empty after each round the cards are gathered up from the
tableau and dealt to the rows without being shuffled using the same
dealing rules as in the first round.  The foundations take two complete
rounds of a suit.  After the first Raja is played to a foundation the
second Ace will play.

<p>
The reserve stack will take any four cards from the rows.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Use the reserve stack to allow buried cards to play.  The best times
to use it are just before a redeal.  Once played to the reserve a
card may only be moved from it to a foundation.
