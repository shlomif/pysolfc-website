<h1>Diamond Mine</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Remove all diamonds to the foundation and have all the other cards in suit and
sequence with Aces being low in the Tableau.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards (other than diamonds) can be built down in sequence regardless of suit.
Builds of cards can be moved as a unit. Empty slots can be filled by any card
(except for diamonds) or build of cards.
<p>
Diamonds cannot be moved except to be place on to the Foundation. The diamond
Foundation must be built up in sequence but can start from any number you
want.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Mining for diamonds is hard work. Keep in mind that not all diamonds are worth
the same. Don't forget to clean up after yourself and put the other suits in
order.
