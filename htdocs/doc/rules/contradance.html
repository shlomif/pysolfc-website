<h1>Contradance</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Contradance (also known as Cotillion) is a solitaire card game which is played
with two decks of playing cards. It is probably so called because when the
game is won, it shows the king and the queen of each suit about to do a dance.
It should not be confused with another solitaire game of Royal Cotillion.
<p>
Before the game starts, all fives and sixes are separated from the shuffled
decks and placed on the table. These sixteen cards are the foundations; the
fives are built down to aces, then kings, while the sixes are built up to
queens, all by suit.
<p>
The stock is dealt one at a time, and cards that cannot be built yet on the
foundations are placed on a wastepile, the top card of which is available for
play on the foundations. The predominant rule sets allow only one redeal. To
do this, the unplayed cards on the wastepile are picked up and turned face
down to make the new stock.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are built on the foundations.
