<h1>Spaces and Aces</h1>
<p>
Montana type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 12 cards in ascending sequence
by suit from Ace to King.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The game is played similar to <a href="montana.html">Montana</a>,
with the entire deck shuffled and dealt out in four rows.  However,
unlike Montana, the aces are not removed.  They may immediately be
moved to empty spaces to the left of each row.
<p>
Cards may be moved to an empty space if they are the same suit as the
card directly to the left and higher in rank. Kings are
high, so no cards may be placed to their right (they create dead spaces).
<p>
Unlike Montana, no redeals are allowed.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<i>Autodrop</i> is disabled for this game.
