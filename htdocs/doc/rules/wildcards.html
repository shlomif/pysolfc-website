<h1>Wildcards</h1>
<p>
Beleaguered Castle type. 1 joker deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to ten tableau piles, with the first pile
containing one card, the second containing two, and so on, up
until the last two piles containing nine cards.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by alternating colors, and cards
can be moved between tableau piles one at a time.  Foundations
are built up by suit, starting from aces.
<p>
There are two jokers in the layout, which are wild cards.  Any
card can be played on a joker, and a joker can be played on any
pile.  Jokers can be moved to a fifth joker foundation, but only
after all other cards have been moved.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
