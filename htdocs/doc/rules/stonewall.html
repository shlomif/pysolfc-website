<h1>Stonewall</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Stonewall is a solitaire card game using a deck of 52 playing cards. It is
probably named because the player seems to break down walls as one exposes
more of the face-down cards. Its tableau is similar to that of Flower Garden
with its beds as columns.
<p>
Thirty-six cards are dealt onto the tableau into six columns of six cards
each. It should be noted that the exposed (top) card and the third and fifth
cards from it are faced up while the second, fourth, and sixth cards from the
top are faced down. The 16 leftover cards act as the reserve.
<p>
The object of the game is to move the Aces to the foundations and build each
of them up by suit.
<p>
The top cards of each column, as well as all the cards in the reserve, are
available for play to the foundations or the tableau. Building on the tableau
is down by alternating colors and a sequence (or a part of a sequence) can be
moved as unit. Any gap on the tableau can be filled by any exposed card or any
sequence.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are built onto the foundations. But chances of
winning are low, especially, for instance, that the needed cards are those
faced down.
