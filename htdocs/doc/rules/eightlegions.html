<h1>Eight legions</h1>
Mughal Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Arrange all cards in suit and rank order on the tableau.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
The cards build down by rank only on the tableau.  The ten reserve
stacks hold one card each.  The game is won when all cards are on the
tableau in suit and rank order.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The game begins with five cards on each of the twelve rows and the ten
reserve stacks empty.  Cards are dealt from the talon twelve at a time, one
to each row.  Rows can be built with cards of any suit in descending rank.
Only Mirs can be played on an empty row.  All twelve suits must be in
descending rank order for the game to be won.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Make as many plays as possible without filling too many reserves before taking
another deal.  Put a priority on getting the Mirs and Wazirs in place.
