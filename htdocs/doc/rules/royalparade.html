<h1>Royal Parade</h1>
<p>
Picture Gallery type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Royal Parade is a variation of
<a href="picturegallery.html">Picture Gallery</a>
Similarly, the layout consists of three rows of playing piles, a row for
newly-dealt cards, and a castoff pile for Aces.
<p>
All Aces are cast off to the pile on the right.  Use the &lt;A&gt; key.
When you clear a space on the tableau, you can only fill it with the right card:
<ul>
<li>In the first row, you build up sequences starting with a Two,
<li>in the second row with a Three, and in the
<li>third row with a Four.
</ul>
Additionally, the position of two cards on the tableau can be swapped
if both of them would end up in the correct row as a result.
<p>
You build up sequences incrementing by three, up to
the face cards.  Thus, in the first row, each pile is 2-5-8-Jack, in the
second row 3-6-9-Queen, and in the third row, 4-7-10-King. Once a sequence has
been started, you have to follow suit.
<p>
If you clear a space at the bottom it will get automatically filled
with a card from the talon. If the talon is empty, clear spaces in the talon
cannot be filled.
