<h1>Forest Glade</h1>
<p>
Fan game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt into 16 piles of three cards.  Tableau piles
are built down by same suit, only one card can be moved at a time.
Empty piles can be filled by kings.
<p>
There are two sets of foundations.  One set is built up starting
from ace with odd numbered ranks (A-3-5-7-9-J-K) and the other
is built up from two with even numbered ranks (2-4-6-8-10-Q).
<p>
The cards can be reshuffled and redealed twice.  If there are
any empty spaces, three cards from the stock can be dealt to
fill that pile (this does not count as a redeal).
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
