<h1>Four Colours</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to four tableau piles, with each pile containing
all the cards of a single suit.  There are also three additional
empty tableau piles.  Tableau piles are built down by alternate
color, and any valid sequence can be moved between piles.
<p>
There are four free cells, located above the first four tableau
piles.  Each free cell can only contain a card of the same suit
as the tableau pile directly below it.
<p>
Foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.  The game
is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
