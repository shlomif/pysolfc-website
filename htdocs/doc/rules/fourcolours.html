<h1>Four Colours</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to four tableau piles, with each pile containing
all the cards of a single suit.  There are also three additional
empty tableau piles.  Tableau piles are built down by alternate
color, and any valid sequence can be moved between piles.
<p>
There are four free cells, located above the first four tableau
piles.  Each free cell can only contain a card of the same suit
as the tableau pile directly below it.

Foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.  The game
is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
