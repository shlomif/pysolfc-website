<h1>Thirty</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 stripped deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Thirty is played with a deck of only 32 cards, including the 7 through
ace of each suit.
<p>
Thirty cards are dealt to six piles of five cards each, with the
remaining two cards set aside as reserve cards.  Tableau piles are
built down by rank, regardless of suit, though only sequences of cards
of the same suit can be moved together.  The reserve cards can be
moved to appropriate tableau or foundation piles at any time.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit, starting with the ace.
Then, the seven is played on the ace and it is built up to king.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
