<h1>Cherry Bomb</h1>
Hanafuda type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
This is a double deck version of
<a href="firecracker.html">Fire Cracker</a>.
The rows build down in rank in the same suit.  The foundations
build with cards of the same rank in suit order.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The rows build from first rank to fourth rank by suit.  The foundations
build in ascending suit order from Pine to Phoenix by rank.  The third
and fourth rank (trash) cards are interchangeable on the tableau.  Cards
may not be played from the foundations.  Any card or correctly ordered
pile may be played on an empty row.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Build sequences on the tableau.  Since the trash cards are interchangeable
it's possible to build a valid sequence that has more than four cards in
a two deck game.
