<h1>Daddy Longlegs</h1>
<p>Spider type. 1 deck. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Group all the cards into four sets of 13 cards by suit in ascending sequence from Ace to King.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Cards are dealt four at a time, one card into each of four piles.  A card can be moved onto the end of another pile, if it is the same suit and follows in sequence.  The rest of the pile moves with the card.  Only an Ace (with the rest of its pile) can move to an empty space.</p>
<p>At any time, you can deal more cards by clicking on the talon. One card will be added to each of the playing piles.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>I created Daddy Longlegs in the early 1980's to amuse myself with a different solitaire variant.  Over the years, I have implemented this game many times under the name of "Deal Four" as an exercise when learning new programming languages.</p>
<p>I learned of pysol in 2006 and almost immediately realized that it is a perfect platform for Daddy Longlegs.  Thank you, Markus Oberhumer!</p>
