<h1>Trapdoor</h1>
<p>
Gypsy type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to eight tableau piles of three cards each.
Only the top card of each pile is face-up.  Eight cards are
dealt to eight reserve piles, one below each tableau pile.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by alternate color.  Any card
or valid sequence of cards can be moved between piles.  Cards
from the reserve can be moved to the tableau, but building on
the reserves is otherwise not allowed.
<p>
When there are no moves left, the card from each reserve can
be moved to the top of the associated tableau pile, and
eight new cards are dealt to the reserve.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
