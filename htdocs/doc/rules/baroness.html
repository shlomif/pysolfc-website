<h1>Baroness</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Baroness is a solitaire card game that is played with a deck of 52 playing
cards. Also known as <b>Five Piles</b> and <b>Thirteens</b>, it is a game that
has an arrangement that is almost like that of Aces Up but with the game play
of Pyramid.
<p>
Five cards are dealt in a row; they will form the bases of the five piles, the
top cards of which are available for play.
<p>
In order to win, one has to remove Kings and pairs of cards that total 13. In
this game, spot cards are taken at face value, Jacks value at 11, Queens 12,
and Kings 13. So the following combinations of cards are discarded:
<ul>
<li>Queen and Ace
<li>Jack and 2
<li>10 and 3
<li>9 and 4
<li>8 and 5
<li>7 and 6
<li>Kings on their own.
</ul>
<p>
When gaps occur, they are filled by the top cards of the other piles; but when
there are not enough cards to do this (less than five), cards from the stock
are used.
<p>
When gaps are filled and no kings and/or pairs of cards totalling 13 are
present, five new cards are dealt from the stock, one onto each pile. Game
play then continues, with the top cards of each pile, as mentioned above, are
available. This cycle of discarding and dealing of new cards goes on until the
stock has been used up.
<p>
The game is successfully won when all cards have been discarded.
