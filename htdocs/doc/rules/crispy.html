<h1>Crispy</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards except the picture cards to the single foundation.
The picture cards are to be arranged in the tableau with the jacks
in the corners, kings on the top and bottom, and queens on the
sides.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt in a four by four grid.  Pairs of cards of the same
rank, except picture cards, can be removed.  Picture cards can be
moved to the edges of the tableau - jacks to the corners, kings
to the top and bottom, and queens to the sides.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal one card from the talon
to each empty tableau space.  The game is won if all cards are
removed, except the picture cards, which are in their respective
spaces.
