<p>
Spider type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in descending sequence
by suit from King to Ace and move such sets to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to 10 piles of four cards each.  Tableau piled are built
down, regardless of suit.  However, only sequences that are all of the same
suit can be moved as a sequence.  A space can be filled by any card or legal
group of cards.
<p>
The object is to group the cards in sets of 13 cards, from King to Ace
of the same suit.  Such groups can be moved to the foundations.
<p>
When no more moves are possible, you can deal cards from the talon one at
a time, and can move them to the tableau.  No redeal is allowed.  The game
is won if you can move all eight same suit sequences to the foundations.
