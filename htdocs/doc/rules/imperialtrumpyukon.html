<h1>Imperial Trump Yukon</h1>
<p>
Tarock type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This game is similar to <a href="yukon.html">Yukon</a> except the twenty-two trump
cards will play on any suit card of the next higher rank.
Cards will play on the foundation only if the trump card of
equal rank is played first.  That means the Ace of Spades
won't play on the Spade foundation until the Ace of Trumps
is played on the Trump foundation.  Only Kings or the highest
ranked Trump can be played on an empty row stack.  The highest
Trump is called either the Fool or the Skiz depending on the
type of deck.  It has either the number 0 or is not numbered.
Cards can be played from the foundations to the tableau.
