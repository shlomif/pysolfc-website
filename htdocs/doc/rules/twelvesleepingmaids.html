<h1>Twelve Sleeping Maids</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of eight tableau piles, and four cards
are dealt to each of twelve reserves - these are the titular twelve
sleeping maids.  The tableau piles are built down by same suit, and
any card or valid sequence of cards can be moved between tableau piles.
When there is an empty tableau pile, flip the top card in the leftmost
of the maid piles if it is not flipped already.  This card can be
moved to the foundations or tableau.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can draw cards from the talon one at
a time, and move them to the tableau or foundations.  Two redeals are
allowed.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from king, turning the corner
to ace, then building all the way up to queen.  The game is won if all
cards are moved to the foundations.
