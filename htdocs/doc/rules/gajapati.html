<h1>Gajapati</h1>
Mughal Ganjifa type. One deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to
<a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>.
The rows build down by rank and by suit.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The cards on the tableau build down in ranks of the same suit.
The foundations build up in rank by suit starting with the Ace.
Any card or movable pile of cards may be played on an empty row.
Cards are dealt from the talon three at a time.  There is no limit
on redeals.  Cards may be played from the foundations.
<p>
This game is one of a series of games that have names ending in "pati"
which transliterates as "lord of".  Gajapati means "Lord of Elephants".
The names are the names of the suits in a twelve suit Ganjifa deck.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Uncover the deepest row stacks first.  Play is simple but the odds
against winning this one are high.
