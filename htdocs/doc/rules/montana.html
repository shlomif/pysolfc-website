<h1>Montana</h1>
<p>
Montana type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 12 cards in ascending sequence
by suit from Two to King.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and dealt
out in four rows.  The Aces are then removed
making 4 initial free spaces.  You may move to a space only the card that
matches the left neighbor in suit, and is one greater in rank.  Kings are
high, so no cards may be placed to their right (they create dead spaces).
<p>
When no moves can be made, cards still out of sequence are reshuffled
and dealt face up after the ends of the partial sequences, leaving a card
space after each sequence, so that each row looks like a partial sequence
followed by a space, followed by enough cards to make a row of 13.

redeals. But only 2 redeals are allowed...

<i>Gaps</i>.
