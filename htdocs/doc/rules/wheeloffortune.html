<h1>Wheel of Fortune</h1>
<p>
Tarock type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards on the tableau build down by suit.  Only two cards
can be placed on a row stack.  Only one card can be moved at a
time.  Any card can be played on an empty row stack.
The foundations build up in rank from the Ace by suit.
Cards are dealt from the talon two at a time.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Keeping one or more open row stacks is critical in the early
stages of the game since the cards are dealt two at a time.
It's also important not to let low ranked cards get buried
too deep in the waste stack.  Do all you can to place as
many cards as possible on the row stacks.
