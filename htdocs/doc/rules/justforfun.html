<h1>Just For Fun</h1>
Hanafuda type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to
<a href="freecell.html">FreeCell</a>.
The rows build down by rank in the same suit.  The foundations
build with cards of the same rank in suit order.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The rows build from first rank to fourth rank by suit.  The foundations
build in ascending suit order from Pine to Phoenix by rank.  The third
and fourth rank (trash) cards are not interchangeable on the tableau.
Cards may not be played from the foundations.  Only first rank cards
or correctly ordered piles may be played on an empty row.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Use the reserve stacks to release the fourth rank cards first.
