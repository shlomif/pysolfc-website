<h1>Bear River</h1>
<p>
Fan game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The cards are dealt into fifteen piles of three cards and
three piles of two.  The remaining card is dealt to a foundation.
Foundations are built up by suit, starting from the rank of the
dealt card, turning the corner as needed (ace can be played on king).
<p>
Tableau piles are built up or down by same suit, though no more than
3 cards can be placed in each tableau pile.  Cards cannot be placed in
the empty tableau piles, with the exception of the three piles that
started with two cards - any card can be placed in those when they're
empty.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
