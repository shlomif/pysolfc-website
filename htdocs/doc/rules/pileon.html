<h1>PileOn</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Rearrange the cards so that each pile contains four cards with the
same rank.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Rearrange the cards so that each pile contains four cards with the
same rank. This should leave two piles empty.
<p>
Cards can be moved on top of any other card or cards of the same rank.
Groups of cards can be moved if they are of the same rank.
<p>
A pile cannot have more than four cards, and an empty slot
can be filled with any card or group of cards with the same rank.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Keep one of the piles clear as much as possible. Don't allow a pile of
three cards to build up on top of a single card, especially if the
final card from the set is not a bottom card in another pile.
