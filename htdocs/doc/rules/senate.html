<h1>Senate</h1>
<p>
Raglan type. 2 decks. No redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of four tableau piles,
and eight reserve piles.  The aces are all dealt
to the foundations.  The tableau piles are built
down by same suit, and any card or sequence of
cards can be moved between tableau piles.  Any card
or sequence can be moved to an empty tableau pile.
You cannot build on the reserves, and cards can only
be moved from the reserves to the tableau or
foundation one at a time.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal a single
card from the deck to each of the reserve piles.
<p>
The foundations are built up by suit from ace to
king.  The game is won when all cards are moved
to the foundations.
