<h1>Big Bertha</h1>
<p>
Raglan type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to fifteen tableau piles of six cards each.  The remaining
fourteen cards are set aside as reserve cards.  Tableau piles are built
down by alternate color, and any card or valid sequence of cards can be
moved between piles, and any card or sequence can be moved to fill empty
tableau piles.  Cards from the reserve cards can be moved to appropriate
tableau or foundation piles.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to queen, and there is
one additional foundation placed next to the reserve cards where the kings
are to be moved.  The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
