<h1>Gypsy</h1>
<p>
Gypsy type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The eight playing piles in the tableau all start with two
cards face-down and one showing.
Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space can be filled
with any card or sequence.
<p>
When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card will be
added to each of the playing piles.
<p>
You are also permitted to move cards back out of the foundation.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Making heavy use of the Undo key is explicitly encouraged here - you can win
quite a number of games with a little bit of thought.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
Gypsy is my all time favorite - it is probably the reason
that I started writing PySol at all...
<p>
I first met Gypsy almost fifteen years ago in the nice
Atari ST game <i>Patience</i> written by Volker Weidner.
And as there seems to be no official name of
this variant I adopted the name Gypsy from another
game called <i>xpat2</i>.
