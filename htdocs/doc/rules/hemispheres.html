<h1>Hemispheres</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The four red aces and four black kings are placed in
foundation piles in the middle of the play area.  Sixteen
cards are dealt in a circle around these foundations,
forming the tableau.  Specific cards are dealt to the top,
bottom, and left, and right-most piles as follows:
<ul>
<li>Top - Ace of Spades</li>
<li>Bottom - Ace of Clubs</li>
<li>Left - King of Diamonds</li>
<li>Right - King of Hearts</li>
</ul>
<p>
Building is not allowed on those four cards, though they can
be moved to the foundations at the end of the game.
<p>
The remaining six tableau piles on the top half of the tableau
are built down by same color, and only red cards are allowed
to be built.  The last six tableau piles on the bottom half are
built up by same color, with only black cards allowed to be built
on.  A single red card in the bottom tableau can be switched with
a single black card in the top.  Empty piles in the tableau are
immediately filled with the top card from the waste pile.  If the
waste and talon are empty, they can be filled with any card.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time, and can be moved to
the tableau or foundations.  No redeal is allowed.  The red
foundations are built up by same suit, while the black foundations
are built down by same suit.  The game is won if all cards are
moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
This game is also known as The Four Continents.
