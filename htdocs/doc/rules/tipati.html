<h1>Tipati</h1>
Mughal Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to
<a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>.
The rows build down by rank regardless of suit.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The cards on the tableau build down by rank.  The foundations build
up in rank by suit starting with the Ace.  Only the Mirs (Kings) may
be played on an empty row.  Cards are dealt from the talon one at
a time.  There are no redeals.  Cards may not be played from the
foundations.
<p>
This game is one of a series of games that have names ending in "pati"
which transliterates as "lord of".  Tipati means "Lord (Highest/Queen) of
Women".  The names are the names of the suits in a twelve suit Ganjifa deck.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Move cards back and forth on the rows to make every play possible.
Don't let the waste stack get too deep.
