<h1>Adela</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A single card is dealt to each of nine tableau piles.  The
tableau piles are built up by same suit, and empty piles are
immediately filled from the talon.
<p>
There are three rows of foundations.  The first row is built down
by suit, from Jack to Ace.  The second row just contains a Queen of
the same suit as the foundation above it, and the third similarly
gets a single King.  Cards cannot be moved to the second or third
row foundations until the Jack has been dealt to the first row.
<p>
When there are no more moves, you can deal one card from the talon
to each of the nine tableau piles.  The game is won if all cards
are moved to the foundations.
