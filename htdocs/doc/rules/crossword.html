<h1>Crossword</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Arrange 49 cards into a seven by seven grid.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>A single card is dealt in the center of a seven by seven grid.  One by one, deal the remaining
cards into the grid, each next to another card, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Non-face cards in the grid must be played in sequences that total up to even numbers.  Once a card
is played, it cannot be moved.
<p>Face cards played in the grid separate the different sequences, similar to how the black
spaces separate words in an actual crossword puzzle.  As such, when a face card is played, it is
flipped face down.  Two face cards cannot be played directly adjacent to each other horizontally or
vertically (though them touching diagonally is allowed).
<p>Once there is only one open space in the grid remaining, the last four cards in the deck are dealt
out and you can play any one of them into the last space.  The game is won if 49 cards can be
successfully played into the grid.
