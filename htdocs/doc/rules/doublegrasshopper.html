<h1>Double Grasshopper</h1>
<p>
Tarock type. 2 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tableau consists of one reserve stack, two Trumps only row stacks,
and nine row stacks.  Twenty-eight cards are dealt to the reserve
stack and one card each to the row stacks.  When a row stack is emptied
it must be filled from the reserve stack first.  When the reserve stack
is empty any card can be played on an empty row stack.  The Trumps only
stacks are left empty and can be played on at will.  The row stacks
build down in rank by alternate colors.  The Trumps can be played as
either color.  The Trumps only row stacks also build down in rank.  They
will accept a stack of cards that contains suit cards as long as the
bottom card is a Trump.  The foundations build up in rank by suit.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
With skillful play and a bit of luck it's possible to sweep this one
without needing the redeal.  The first priority is to empty the reserve
stack.  Once that's done try to keep one or more row stacks open.  Play
high rank cards on the rows and build down on them.  The same goes for
the Trumps only rows.
