<h1>Four Seasons</h1>
Hanafuda type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Arrange all the cards on the rows.

<h3>Rules</h3>
This is a <a href="fan.html">Fan</a>
type game adapted to the Hanafuda cards.  The tableau consists of
twelve rows.  Any stack may be moved, but only a first rank card
will play on an empty row.  The trash cards are not interchangable,
and no more than eight cards can be played on a row.  The game is
won when all twelve suits are arranged in order in their respective
places on the tableau.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Not all Four Seasons hands are solvable.  Try to get an open row.
