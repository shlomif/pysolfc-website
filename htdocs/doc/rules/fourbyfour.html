<h1>Four by Four</h1>
<p>
One-deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A single card is dealt to the foundation.  The foundation is built up with
cards of the same rank.  Once all four cards of that rank are in the foundation,
you may place cards with the next rank up - so if a three is dealt first, all four
threes can be added to the foundation, and once they're there, you can start placing
fours.  Once kings are played, the sequence turns the corner and continues from ace.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock one at a time, and waste cards can be moved to one of
four tableau stacks.  The tableau stacks are built up or down by rank, regardless of
suit.  Cards may only be moved one at a time.  There is no redeal.
