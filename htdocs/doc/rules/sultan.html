<h1>Sultan</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Nine cards are laid out into nine foundation cards, with the kings of
diamonds, clubs, and spades in the left and right columns, with the
center column consisting of an ace of hearts in the top, and the two
kings of hearts below.  The center king of hearts is called the Sultan,
and no cards can be played on it.  Aces can be played on the remaining
kings, and these foundations are built up by suit to queens.
<p>
Six additional cards are dealt to six reserve piles.  Cards from the
reserve can be moved to appropriate foundations.  Cards are dealt from
the talon one at a time, and can be moved to the foundations as well, or to
empty reserves.  You can redeal up to twice per game, meaning you can go
through the deck a total of three times.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations, resulting in
the Sultan surrounded by his queens.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
This game is also known as Sultan of Turkey, or less commonly,
Emperor of Germany.
