<h1>S Patience</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card of each rank is dealt to each of thirteen foundation
piles, arranged like the letter S.  These foundations are built
up by rank, regardless of suit, with a max of 8 cards in each
pile.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time, and can be moved
to the foundations, or one of two tableau piles.  Building on
these tableau piles is not allowed, and the top card of either
can be moved to an appropriate foundation.  No redeal is allowed.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
