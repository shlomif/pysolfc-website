<h1>Minerva</h1>
<p>
Canfield type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to seven piles of four cards each, with the
first and third card in each pile face-down and the second and
top card face-up.  Eleven cards are dealt to a reserve pile,
with only the top one face-up.  Tableau piles are built down
by alternate color, and any card or valid sequence of cards
can be moved between piles.  Empty piles can only be filled
by kings.
<p>
The top card of the reserve can be moved to the tableau or
foundations, but cards cannot be moved to the reserve.  Cards
are drawn from the talon one at a time, and can be moved to
the tableau or foundations.  One redeal is allowed.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
