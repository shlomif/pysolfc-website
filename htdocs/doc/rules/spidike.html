<h1>Spidike</h1>
<p>
Spider type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt in seven tableau piles, each with a different number of
cards, from one to seven, all face-up.
<p>
The tableau piles are built down, regardless of suit.  However, sequences
that are all of the same suit are preferred because these are available
for further movement.  An empty tableau pile can only be filled by a king.
<p>
Aces can be moved to the foundations, which are built up by same suit from
ace to king.
<p>
When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card will be
added to each of the playing piles.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Spidike is a combination of the games Spider and Klondike, that
was invented by Thomas Warfield.
