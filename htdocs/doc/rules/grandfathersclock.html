<h1>Grandfather's Clock</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A circle of twelve cards are dealt out to the foundations.  The two
of spades is dealt in the five o'clock position, each pile clockwise
dealt with a rank one higher, in suit order spades-hearts-clubs-diamonds,
leading to the king of diamonds in the four o'clock position.  The
remaining cards are dealt out to eight piles of five cards each.

Move cards to the foundations until the top of each foundation is the
clock number for that position. Jack equals 11, Queen equals 12, and
Aces must be placed on Kings.

The playing piles build down by rank regardless of suit. Only the top card
is available for play, and empty rows may be filled with any single card.
