<h1>Shady Lanes</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of four tableau piles, and four reserve cards
are set aside.  The tableau piles are built down by alternate color, and
only single cards can be moved between tableau piles.  Empty tableau
piles can be filled with one of the reserve cards.  Cards from the
reserve can also be moved to the tableau.  An empty reserve card is
immediately replaced from the stock.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards one at a time from the
talon, and move them to the tableau or foundations.  The foundations
are built up by same color from ace to king.  The game is won if all
cards are moved to the foundations.
