<h1>Idle Aces</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
There are three sets of foundations.  A king of each suit is
dealt to the first set, and a two of each suit is dealt to
the second set.  The foundations with the kings are built down
by same suit to ace, while the foundations with the twos are
built up by same suit to king.  The remaining ace of each suit,
can be played in third set of foundations.

Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time, and can be moved
to an appropriate foundation.  Two redeals are allowed.  The
game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
