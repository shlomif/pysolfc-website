The rows build down in rank by same suit.  The foundations
build up in rank by suit.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The rows build from first rank to fourth rank by suit.  The foundations
build from fourth to first.  The third and fourth rank (trash) cards are
not interchangeable on the tableau.  Cards may not be played from the
foundations.  Cards are dealt from the talon three at a time and
