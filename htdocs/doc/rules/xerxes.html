<h1>Xerxes</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 stripped decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Xerxes is played with only the nines through kings of each
suit from two decks, plus the aces.  The remaining cards are
removed.
<p>
One nine is dealt to the first foundation pile, and a tableau pile
of cards is dealt underneath it.  When each nine is dealt, that is
dealt to the next foundation, and the next tableau pile is started
underneath it, until all cards are dealt.
<p>
Any card can be moved to an empty tableau pile, but otherwise, no
building on the tableau is allowed.  The foundation piles are built
up from nine to king, then ace, regardless of suit.  The game is won
if all cards are moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
