<h1>Acme</h1>
<p>
Canfield type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Four cards are dealt to four tableau piles, and 13 cards are
dealt to a reserve.  The aces are dealt to four foundation
piles.
<p>
The tableau piles are built down by same suit.  Single cards
can be moved between tableau piles, or cards from the reserve
can be moved to a tableau pile.  Empty tableau piles are
immediately filled from the reserve.  Foundations are built up
by same suit from ace to king.
<p>
Cards can be dealt from the talon one at a time.  These cards
can be moved to a tableau or foundation pile.  You are allowed
one redeal, so you can go through the stock twice.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are moved to the foundations.
