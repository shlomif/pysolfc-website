<h1>New York</h1>
<p>
Fan game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of eight tableau piles, and one
card is dealt to the foundations to determine the base rank
of the foundations.  The tableau piles are built down by
alternate color, turning the corner from ace to king as
necessary.  Only single cards can be moved between tableau
piles.  Any card can be used to fill an empty tableau pile.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time, and can be
moved to the foundation, tableau, or one of three reserve
piles.  The card on the top of each reserve pile can be moved
to an appropriate tableau or foundation, but cards can only
be moved to these reserves from the talon directly.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit, starting with the
rank dealt to the foundations at the start of the game, turning
the corner from king to ace as necessary.  The game is won
if all cards are moved to the foundations.
