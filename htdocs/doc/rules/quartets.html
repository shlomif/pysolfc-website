<h1>Quartets</h1>
<p>
One deck type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards may be moved between the tableau piles, moving one card at a time.
The tableau piles are built up or down by alternating colors.
<p>
There are four reserves, each of which can hold one card.  If all four
reserves hold a card of the same rank, all four of them are moved to the
foundation.  The game is won when the entire deck is moved to the
foundation in this way.
