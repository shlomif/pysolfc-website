<h1>Carcassonne</h1>
<p>
Napoleon type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, an ace and a king of each suit are dealt
to the foundations.  The remaining aces and kings are dealt out to
the bottom of the tableau piles.  Sixteen cards are dealt in an
additional pile, containing alternating rows of one and two cards,
located in the center, between the fourth and fifth piles.  The remaining
cards are dealt to the tableau, but any card that can be moved to
the foundations is moved there immediately after each row is dealt.
<p>
No building is allowed in this center pile, and cards can only
be moved from it if all of their covering cards are removed.
The remaining tableau piles are built up or down by rank, regardless
of suit, with only individual cards allowed to be moved between
tableau piles.  Empty piles cannot be filled.
<p>
The foundations with aces are built up by same suit from ace to king,
while the foundations with kings are built down by same suit from
king to ace.  The game is won if all cards are moved to the
foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Remember that you can move cards between foundations.
