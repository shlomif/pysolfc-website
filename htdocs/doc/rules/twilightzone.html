<h1>Twilight Zone</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of four tableau piles and four
reserve piles.  The tableau piles are built down by alternate
color, arranged so only the top card is visible.  Empty tableau
piles are immediately filled with the reserve card directly below
it, and empty reserve cards are filled from the waste, or the
stock if the waste is empty.  Cards from the reserve can be moved
to the tableau, but not foundations.
<p>
When there are no moves left, cards can be flipped from the talon
one at a time, and moved to either the tableau, foundations, or
the waste pile.  Once moved to the waste pile, a card cannot be
moved to the tableau or foundations.  One redeal is allowed.
<p>
The foundations are built up by alternate color from ace to king.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
