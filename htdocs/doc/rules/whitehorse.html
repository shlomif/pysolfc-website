<h3>Rules</h3>

Seven cards are dealt to seven tableau piles.  The tableau piles
are built down by alternate color, and any valid sequence of cards
can be moved between piles.  Empty tableau spaces are immediately
filled from the top card of the waste.
<p>
Cards can be dealt three at a time from the tableau to the waste pile.
The top card of the waste pile can be moved to the tableau or
foundations.
<p>
Foundations are built up by suit from ace to king.  The game is won
if all cards are moved to the foundations.
