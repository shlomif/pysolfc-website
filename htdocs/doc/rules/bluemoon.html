<h1>Blue Moon</h1>
<p>
Montana type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in ascending sequence
by suit from Ace to King.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Just like <a href="montana.html">Montana</a>,
but the Aces are moved to the left.
<br>Gameplay is completely equivalent.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This 52-card solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and dealt
out in four rows.  The aces are then moved to the left end of the layout,
making 4 initial free spaces.  You may move to a space only the card that
matches the left neighbor in suit, and is one greater in rank.  Kings are
high, so no cards may be placed to their right (they create dead spaces).
<p>
When no moves can be made,  cards still out of sequence are  reshuffled
and dealt face up after the ends of the partial sequences, leaving a card
space after each sequence, so that each row looks like a partial sequence
followed by a space, followed by enough cards to make a row of 14.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<i>Autodrop</i> is disabled for this game.
