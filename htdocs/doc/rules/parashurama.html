<h1>Parashumrama</h1>
Dashavatara Ganjifa type. One deck. One redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to
<a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>.
The rows build down by rank only.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The cards on the tableau build down in rank regardless of suit.  The
foundations build up in rank by suit starting with the Ace.  The cards
are dealt from the talon three at a time.  There is one redeal.  Only Mirs
(Kings) may be played on an empty row.  Cards may not be played from the
foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
The waste stack will be the biggest problem area.  Play from it first.
Move cards on the tableau to make every play possible before dealing
more cards.
