<h1>Well</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 4 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Ten cards are dealt to each of four reserve piles, arranged
in a diamond pattern in the center of the play area.  A single
card is dealt to each of four tableau piles, one dealt next to
each of the reserves.  The tableau piles are built up by same
suit, and if they are empty, they are immediately filled with
the top card from the adjacent reserve.  If the reserve is
empty, that pile can be filled with any card.  Cards from the
reserve can also be freely moved to any tableau pile or foundation,
though cards cannot be placed in the reserve.
<p>
There is one additional tableau pile that is set aside from the
others.  An ace can be dealt to start this pile, and it can be
built up by same suit like the other.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the stock to
each of five waste piles, and the cards from these waste piles can
be moved to tableau or foundation piles.  When the stock is empty,
you can combine the waste piles to form a new stock and redeal.
You are allowed four redeals, though during each redeal, you use
one fewer waste pile than you did on the previous deal.
<p>
The foundations are built down by same suit from king to ace, then
turning the corner from ace to king, and built down to ace a second
time.  The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
