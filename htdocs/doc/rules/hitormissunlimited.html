<h1>Hit or Miss Unlimited</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundation.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Just like <a href="hitormiss.html">Hit or Miss</a>,
but with unlimited redeals.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The traditional rules of Hit or Miss only allow you to go through
the deck twice without getting a hit, but this rule is often
overlooked due to the extreme difficulty of winning the game it
causes.  Most computer versions of Hit or Miss do not use this
rule, but when this rule is omitted, the game is always won unless
the player gets stuck with a multiple of 13 cards left.  This
version does not use this rule, while Hit or Miss does.
