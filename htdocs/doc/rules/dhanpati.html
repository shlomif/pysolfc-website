<h1>Dhanpati</h1>
Mughal Ganjifa type. One deck. One redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to
<a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>.
The rows build down by rank regardless of suit.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The cards on the tableau build down by rank.  The foundations build
up in rank by suit starting with the Ace.  Only the Mirs (Kings) may
be played on an empty row.  Cards are dealt from the talon three at
a time.  There is only one redeal.  Cards may not be played from the
foundations.
<p>
This game is one of a series of games that have names ending in "pati"
which transliterates as "lord of".  Dhanpati means "Lord of Treasure".
The names are the names of the suits in a twelve suit Ganjifa deck.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Move cards back and forth on the rows to make every play possible on
the first pass through the talon.  Don't let the waste stack get too
deep on the second pass.
