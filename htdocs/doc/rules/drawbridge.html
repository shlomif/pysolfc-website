<h1>Drawbridge</h1>
Klondike type. One deck. One redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>
with <a href="../hexadeck.html">Hex A Deck</a>
variations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Klondike.  The rows build down in rank in alternate
color.  Any card or sequence may be played on an empty row.  The Wizards
will play in their proper rank position on the tableau as the alternate of
either red or black.  Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time.  Cards
may be played from the foundations.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
Play cards back off of the foundations to uncover face down cards.
