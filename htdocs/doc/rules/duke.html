<h1>Duke</h1>
<p>
Canfield type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of four tableau piles, and three
cards are dealt to each of four reserves.  Tableau piles are
built down by alternate color, and any card or sequence of
cards can be moved between tableau piles.  Any card or
sequence can fill an empty tableau pile.  Cards from the top
of the reserve piles can be moved to the tableau or foundation,
but cards cannot be moved back to the reserves.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the
talon one at a time, and move them to the tableau or foundation.
Two redeals are allowed.  The foundations are built up by same
suit from ace to king.  The game is won if all cards are moved
to the foundations.
