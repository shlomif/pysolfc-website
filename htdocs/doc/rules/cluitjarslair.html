<h1>Cluitjar's Lair</h1>
Klondike type. One deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>
with <a href="../hexadeck.html">Hex A Deck</a>
variations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Klondike.  The rows build down in rank in alternate
color.  Any card or sequence may be played on an empty row.  The Wizards
will play in their proper rank position on the tableau regardless of
color.  While two or more Wizards will play on top of each other, the stack
must still be of alternating colors to be a movable sequence.  Cards are
dealt from the talon one at a time.  There is no redeal.  Cards may be
played from the foundations.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
The Wizards will not play to their foundation until all the suit cards
are on theirs.  That can make the end game a bit of a puzzle.  Use an
empty row to move them out of the way.
