<h1>Ishido</h1>
<p>
Ishido game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all tiles to the playing area.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tiles are played to an grid of eight rows of twelve columns each.
At the start of the game, a tile is placed in each corner, and two are
placed in two diagonally adjacent spaces in the center.  The initially
placed tiles include one of each color and one of each symbol.
<p>
Tiles are drawn from the talon one at a time, and can be played to the
main playing area.  A tile can only be played if it is adjacent to
another tile, either horizontally or vertically, and if it matches the
adjacent tile's color or symbol.  If a tile is placed next to at least
two other tiles, one must match by color and another by symbol.  If it
is played next to four other tiles, it must match two by color and two
by symbol.
<p>
The game is played if all tiles from the talon can be played to the
playing area.

<p>
Ishido was originally published as a video game "Ishido: The Way of Stones"
by Accolade in 1990.  It has since been recreated many times.
