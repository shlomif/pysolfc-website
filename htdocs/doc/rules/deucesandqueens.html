<h1>Deuces and Queens</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="acesandkings.html">Aces and Kings</a>, but with
three reserves, and one set of foundations builds up from two to ace,
and the other builds down from queen to king, both wrapping between
king and ace as necessary.
<p>
Additionally, building on the tableau piles is allowed.  Tableau
piles are built up or down by rank, regardless of suit, also wrapping
between king and ace as necessary.  But once the talon is empty, empty
tableau piles can no longer be filled.
