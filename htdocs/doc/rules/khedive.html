<h1>Khedive</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
24 cards are dealt to the tableau, in five rows of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9
cards respectively.  No building on the tableau is allowed - cards
from the tableau can only be moved to the foundations, which are built
up by same suit from ace to king.  Empty tableau piles are immediately
filled from the waste pile or talon.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the talon one at
a time.  The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
