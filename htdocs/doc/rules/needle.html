<h1>Needle</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt into nine tableau piles, eight cards in the outermost
four, four cards in the next two, two cards in the next two, and the
middle pile is empty.  The remaining eight cards are dealt to a
reserve.
<p>
Cards can be moved between tableau piles one at a time, building them
down by alternate color, and any card can be used to fill empty piles.
Foundations are built up by suit, starting with aces.
<p>
The top card from the reserve can be moved to an appropriate tableau pile
or foundation.  Any single card can be moved to the reserve, though there
can be no more than eighteen cards in the reserve.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
