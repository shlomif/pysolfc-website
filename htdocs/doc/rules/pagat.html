<h1>Pagat</h1>
<p>
Tarock type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This is a Freecell type of game.  Cards on the tableau build down in rank
by suit.  Cards build up in rank on the foundations.
A stack can be moved if the cards are in decending rank order
regardless of the suit.  Any card or stack can be played on an empty
row.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
The foundations are less important early in the game than
building movable stacks.  Use the reserve stacks carefully.
