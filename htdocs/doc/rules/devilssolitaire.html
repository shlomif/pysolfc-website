<h1>Devil's Solitaire</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the right foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of eight tableau piles, and eight
cards are dealt to a single reserve.  No building is allowed
on the tableau, and empty tableau piles are filled from the waste
pile immediately.
<p>
A single foundation is built up starting with
the rank one higher than the top card of the reserve, regardless
of suit, turning the corner from ace to king as necessary (if the
top card of the reserve is a king, the foundation starts from an
ace).
<p>
If the top card of the reserve can be moved to the foundation, it
is done so immediately, then all of the cards in the foundation
are immediately moved to a second foundation on the right.  Then,
the first foundation is built with the starting card based on the
next card in the reserve.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time, and can be moved to
the foundations.  Two redeals are allowed.  The game is won if all
cards are moved to the foundation on the right.
