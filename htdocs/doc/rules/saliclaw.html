<h1>Salic Law</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations, except for the kings.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, the queens are dealt to an upper row
of foundations, and a single king is dealt to the tableau.  No
further cards are dealt to the queen foundation.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon to a tableau pile one at a time.
While dealing to the tableau, any exposed cards can be moved
to the lower foundations, which are built up by rank from ace to
jack, regardless of suit.
<p>
If a king would be dealt to the tableau, the current tableau
pile is completed, and the king is used to start a new pile.
Cards are dealt to this pile before the next pile.
<p>
Any single card can be moved onto an exposed king in the tableau,
but otherwise, there is no building on the tableau.  The game is
won if all cards other than the kings are moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The name Salic Law is reference to an ancient Frankish law, which
prevented women from claiming the throne or earning inheritance.
