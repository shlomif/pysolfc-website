<h1>Turncoats</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of twelve tableau piles.  The tableau
piles are built up or down by alternate color, arranged so only the
top card of each is visible.  Only single cards can be moved between
piles.  Empty piles are immediately filled with a card from the talon.
When the talon is empty, empty piles cannot be filled.

The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.  The
game is won when all cards are moved to the foundations.
