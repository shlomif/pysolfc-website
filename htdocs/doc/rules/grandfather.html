<h1>Grandfather</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 2 decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Twenty cards are dealt to twenty piles.
<p>
Cards from the tableau can be moved to foundations.  The
four foundations on the left are built up by suit from ace
to king, while the four on the right are built down by suit
from king to ace.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock one at a time and can be moved
to the tableau or foundation piles.  Though each tableau pile
can only have a max of two cards.  Cards cannot be moved
between tableau piles, and empty piles are filled from the
stock immediately.  A single redeal is allowed.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
