<h1>All in a Row II</h1>
<p>
Golf game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tableau is arranged in thirteen piles of four cards each.
Cards can be moved from the tableau to a reserve, which is built
up by rank, regardless of suit.  A sequence of cards can then be
moved from the reserve to the foundation (single cards can't be
moved).
<p>
There is no building on the tableau piles, and spaces
are not filled. Only top cards from reach pile can be moved.
<p>
The first card of each sequence in the reserve can be arbitrarily
selected from the top of any pile.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<i>Autodrop</i> is disabled for this game.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
This is the correct, original variant of the game All in a Row.
<a href="allinarow.html">The other game</a> is based on a common
misinterpretation of the game's rules.
