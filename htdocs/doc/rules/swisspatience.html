<h1>Swiss Patience</h1>
<p>
Gypsy type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Nine tableau piles are dealt, with five cards in the centermost pile,
and descending numbers of cards going left and right.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by alternate color.  Cards and sequences
can be moved between tableau piles.  Aces are treated as being a higher
rank than kings.  Only aces or sequences beginning with aces can be moved
to empty tableau piles.  Foundations are built up by rank, starting with
twos, and building up to aces.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the talon, one to
each tableau pile.  The game is won if all cards are moved to the
foundations.
