<h1>Long Tail</h1>
<p>
Spider type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in descending sequence
by suit from King to Ace and move such sets to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of five tableau piles.  Cards are built down,
regardless of suit.  However, sequences that are all of the same suit
are preferred because these are available for further movement.  A space
can be filled by any card or legal group of cards.
<p>
The object is to group the cards in sets of 13 cards, from King to Ace
of the same suit. Such groups can be moved to the foundations.
<p>
When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card will be
added to each of the playing piles.
<p>
Additionally, there is a single reserve pile.  Two cards are dealt to
this pile at the start of the game, and any cards may be moved to it.
However, only the top card from the reserve can be played back to the
tableau.
