<h1>Frog</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Frog (also known as Toad) is a solitaire card game which is played with two
decks of playing cards. Because of its gameplay, it belongs to the same family
of solitaire games as Strategy, Sir Tommy, Calculation, and Puss in the
Corner.
<p>
Thirteen cards are dealt face up to become the reserve, also known as the
"Frog." Any aces that are about to be dealt are separated and placed in the
foundations; they are not counted in the reserve count. Once the reserve is
formed, it is then squared up (i. e. arranged to become one neat pile) and
placed on the tableau face up. The aces that are separated in making the
reserve are placed next to the reserve. If case there is no ace segregated in
making the reserve, an ace is removed from the stock to become the first
foundation.
<p>
The foundations are built up regardless of suit up to kings. The aces already
in the foundations can be built immediately while any ace that becomes
available in the game is placed in the foundations.
<p>
The cards are dealt one at a time onto one of five wastepiles. It is the
player's discretion where each pile is placed as long as it is placed in one
of only five wastepiles. The top cards of each wastepile is available for play
to the foundations. The same goes for the top card of the reserve. However,
once a card is in a wastepile, it stays there until it can be built on the
foundations. Also, there is no redeal.
<p>
The game ends long after the stock runs out. The game is won when all cards
are built in the foundations.
<p>
As in the other games mentioned above, it is a good idea to reserve a
wastepile for both kings and queens and to build downwards whenever possible
in order to win.

<h3>Fly</h3>
<p>
Fly is a solitaire card game which is played the same way as Frog. The
difference is that the Aces are removed and placed in the foundations before
the game begins. In this game, the reserve is called the "Fly."
