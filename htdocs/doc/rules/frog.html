<h1>Frog</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Thirteen cards are dealt to a reserve called the frog.  If
an ace would be dealt to this reserve, it is dealt to the
foundations instead.
<p>
Cards are dealt one at a time from the stock, and are moved
to one of five tableau stacks, or the foundations.  These stacks
can be built regardless of suit or rank, but once a card is in
the stacks, it can only be moved to the foundations.  Cards in
the reserve can only be moved to the foundations.
<p>
Foundations are built up from ace to king, regardless of suit.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
