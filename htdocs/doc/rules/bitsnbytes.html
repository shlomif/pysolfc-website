<h1>Bits n Bytes</h1>
<p>
Hex A Deck type. 1 deck. One redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Fill all row stacks.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
<p>
Fill Byte stacks by matching the goal card's byte value, fill bit
stacks by matching the corresponding bit value.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
When play begins the four left most columns are filled with four
goal cards of different ranks, one from each suit.  The next two
columns to the right are the byte stacks.  They can be filled
with cards of the same rank as the goal card in that row.  The
four right most columns are the bit stacks.  They can be filled
with cards of the same suit as the goal card in the respective
row if their least significant bit matches the corresponding
bit on the goal card.
<p>
Cards from the talon are turned over to the waste pile, two at a
time.  There is only one redeal.
<p>
The only function of the Wizards in this game is to block the
waste stack at the worst possible time.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Since there are only four cards of any one rank, it's important
to fill the byte columns first.
