<h1>Obstruction</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 joker deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="freecell.html">FreeCell</a>,
but with two jokers.  The jokers are obstacles - they can
only be moved to the free cells, and any cards behind them
are blocked until you do.  Once there, the jokers can only be
moved to the joker foundation, and only once all other cards
have been moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Obstruction is an original game by PySol developer Joe R.  It
is designed as a more strategic version of Michael Keller's
Ephemeral FreeCell, requiring the player to block two of the
free cells as the game progresses.
