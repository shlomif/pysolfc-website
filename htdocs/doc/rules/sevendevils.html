<h1>Seven Devils</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Seven Devils is arguably the most difficult of all solitaire games. It is a
two pack game widely available as a computer version.
<p>
28 cards are dealt out to seven diminishing columns with the bottom card of
each column face up, and a further seven cards (the "devil") are
dealt face up to the right of the columns.
<p>
The aim is to move all the cards into thirteen-card sequences on the goal
piles (at the right of the board), ascending in sequence and following suit,
starting with the Aces.
<p>
Cards on the table can be stacked red-on-black in descending sequence. Any
card can be used to fill an empty column.
<p>
Only one card can be moved at a time, but if there are empty columns multiple
cards can be moved as if the empty columns were used as temporary spots.
<p>
The seven devils in the right-hand stack cannot be placed on other stacks, and
can be moved only to the goal piles.
<p>
The difficulty of this game arises from three factors
<ul>
<li>Many games are unwinnable from the start. If two higher cards overlie any
card in the same suit in the devil, the lower card can never be reached.
<li>Even if this is not the case, if high cards overlay lower ones in the
devil, the low cards can be very difficult to get to.
<li>If low cards like twos or threes cannot be played to a column, they will
be buried in the discard pile, and become difficult to retrieve.
<li>Key low cards may be hidden face down in columns where they may well prove
inaccessible
</ul>
