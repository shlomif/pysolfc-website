<h1>Seven Devils</h1>
<p>
Raglan type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to seven tableau piles, each with one more card than the
previous, with the first pile having one, and the last seven.  Only the top
card of each is face-up.  Seven cards are dealt to seven reserves,  These are
called the seven devils.  These devil cards can only be moved to the foundations.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by alternate color, and only single cards can be
moved between tableau piles.  Any card can fill an empty tableau pile.  When there
are no moves left, cards can be dealt one at a time from the talon, and moved to
an appropriate tableau or foundation pile.  No redeal is allowed.
<p>
Foundation piles are built up in suit from Ace to King.  The game is won if all
cards are moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Seven Devils is widely regarded as one of the most difficult solitaire games,
due to the high likelihood of unwinnable games if certain key cards are
inaccessible due to one of the devils.
