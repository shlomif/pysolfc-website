<h1>Big Forty</h1>

Forty cards are dealt to the tableau in ten piles of four

same suit, and any card or valid sequence of cards can be
moved between tableau piles.  Empty tableau piles can be
be filled by card or sequence.

When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the

Foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
