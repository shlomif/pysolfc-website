<h1>Ten Across</h1>
<p>
Yukon type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in descending sequence
by suit from King to Ace and move such sets to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Five cards are dealt to each of ten tableau piles.  In the first
pile, all cards are face-up.  The bottom card of the second pile
is face-down, and each pile has one more face-down card up to the
fifth.  The remaining piles follow the pattern in reverse.  The
last two cards are dealt to two free cells.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by same suit.  Groups of cards can be
moved regardless of sequence.  An empty pile in the tableau can only
be filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
Single cards can be moved freely between the tableau and free cells.
<p>
The object is to group the cards in sets of 13 cards, from King to Ace
of the same suit. Such groups can be moved to the foundations.
