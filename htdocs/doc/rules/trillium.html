<h1>Trillium</h1>

Spider type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

Arrange all cards in columns with complete sequences from king to ace.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to thirteen piles of four cards each, with alternating
cards face-up and face-down.  Tableau piles are built down by alternate
color, and any card or sequence of cards can be moved between piles.

When there are no moves left, you can deal one card from the top of the
talon to each tableau pile.  The game is won if you're able to organize
