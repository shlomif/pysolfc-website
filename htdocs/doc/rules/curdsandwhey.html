<h1>Curds and Whey</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Curds and Whey is a solitaire card game which uses a deck of 52 playing cards.
Invented by David Parlett, this game belongs to the family of solitaire games
that includes Spider and Scorpion.
<p>
The cards are dealt into 13 piles (or columns) of four cards each. The top
card of each pile is available for play.
<p>
There are no foundations in this game; the object is to form four suit
sequences each running from King down to Ace.
<p>
A card can be built in only two ways:
<ul>
<li>Over a card that is of the same suit and of a higher rank, or
<li>Over a card that is of the same rank but of a different suit.
</ul>
<p>
For example, the 8 of spades can be built over the 9 of spades or any other 8
(such as the 8 of clubs).
<p>
One card can be moved at a time unless a sequence has been made. If a sequence
of cards follows either one of the following two guidelines:
<ul>
<li>Sequences that are built down by suit
<li>Sequences of cards with the same rank
</ul>
...it can be moved as a unit in part or in whole. However, a sequence that
follows both guidelines at once must be rearranged to follow only one
guideline before moving as a unit.
<p>
When a column becomes empty, it can only be filled by a King or a sequence
starting with a King.
<p>
The game is won when the object above is fulfilled, forming four suit
sequences each running from King down to Ace.
