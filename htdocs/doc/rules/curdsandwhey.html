<h1>Curds and Whey</h1>
<p>
Spider type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the tableau, in four columns with complete sequences from
king to ace.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to thirteen piles of four cards each.  Tableau piles
are built down by either same suit or rank.  Any card or valid sequence
of cards can be moved, but combined sequences that contain groups that
are both the same rank or suit cannot be moved.
<p>
Only kings or sequences that begin with kings can be moved to empty
tableau piles.  The game is won if all the cards can be arranged in
four same suit sequences from king to ace.
