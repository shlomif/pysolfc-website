<h1>Hex A Klon</h1>
<p>
Hex A Deck type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>, except any card can
be played on an empty row and the Wizards (Jokers) are wild.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Game play is like Klondike with the Wizards being wild.  They can be played
on the tableau as any rank or color.  Once a Wizard is played on a row however
that row may become unmovable.  The Wizards have ranks like the suit cards
corresponding to Ace through Four.  If a Wizard is played in it's proper rank
position the row can still be moved.  The rank can be determined by the height
of the hat.  The Ace Wizard has the tallest hat.  A stack with two Wizards can
be moved only if they are both in their rank position and they are not ajacent
to each other.  The Wizards will not move off of the tableau until all the other
cards have been moved to the foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Keep the Wizards off of piles that contain face down cards.  Once all the
cards on the tableau are face up try to get the Wizards out of the way.  Put
them all on one row stack until the suit cards have been moved to the foundations.
