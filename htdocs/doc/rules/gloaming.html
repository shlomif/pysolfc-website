<h1>Gloaming</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

<h3>Rules</h3>

All of the cards are dealt into three reserve piles (2 with 17
cards and one with 18).  Cards can be moved from these reserve
piles to one of five tableau piles or the foundations.
<p>
Cards can be placed in tableau piles regardless of rank or suit,
but cards in tableau piles can only be moved to foundations.

Foundations are built up by suit, starting with aces.  The game is
won if all cards are moved to foundations.
