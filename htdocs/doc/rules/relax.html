<h1>Relax</h1>
Hanafuda type. 1 deck. One redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
This is a variation of
<a href="littleeasy.html">Little Easy</a>.
The rows build down by rank in the same suit.  The foundations
build with cards of the same rank in suit order.  Only first
rank cards may be played on an empty row.  Trash card ranks
are interchangeable.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The rules are the same as in
<a href="littleeasy.html">Little Easy</a>
except that the cards deal from the talon one at a time, there
is only one redeal and the third and fourth rank (trash) cards
are interchangeable.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Disable auto drop and build on the rows until all cards are face up.
These games may be easy by name and easy to play but they're not easy
to win.
