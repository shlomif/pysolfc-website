<h1>Kali's Game</h1>
Dashavatara Ganjifa game type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="larasgame.html">Lara's Game</a>
with twelve rows and two redeals.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Refer to the description of the deal in Lara's Game.  The differences
are that the cards are dealt to thirteen piles instead of fourteen
and if a dealt card is of rank Pradhan or over one card is dealt to the
talon.  Only one 120 card Dashavatara deck is used.  Otherwise the
dealing rules are the same.
<p>
Play is the same as Lara's Game except that there are two redeals.  When
the talon is empty after each round the cards are gathered up from the
tableau and dealt to the rows without being shuffled using the same
dealing rules as in the first round.
