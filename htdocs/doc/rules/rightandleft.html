<h1>Right and Left</h1>
<p>
Pairing game type. 2 decks. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Deal cards from the stock two at a time.  Pairs of
cards of the same rank can be moved to the foundation.
Once the stock is empty, the two piles are flipped over
and create a new stock.
<p>
The game is won once all cards are moved to the foundations.
Unlimited redeals are allowed, so all games should turn
out eventually.
