<h1>Captive Queens</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt from the deck one at a time, and can be moved
to one of three rows of foundations.  The top row of foundations
is built down by same suit from five to ace, with the kings then
played on the aces.  The bottom row of foundations is built up
by same suit from six to jack.  The middle row of foundations just
contains the queen of each suit.
<p>
Two redeals are allowed.  The game is won if all cards are moved
to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
The name of the game comes from the fact that the queens are
surrounded by the other foundation cards.
