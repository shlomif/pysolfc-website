<h1>Captive Queens</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Captive Queens is a solitaire card game using a deck of 52 playing cards. The
game is so named because the queens are being "enclosed" as the foundations
are built.
<p>
There are two ways that the queens are played in this game: either they are
laid in the center of the tableau immediately or shuffled into the deck and
laid out later. Either way, their role is just purely decorative and have no
further part in the game.
<p>
The game starts by laying the cards from the stock one at a time into a
wastepile in search for fives or sixes. Once any of these cards are found, it
becomes a foundation and can be placed on a circle surrounding the area where
queens are placed; it can be built upon immediately. The foundations' places
in this circle are irrelevant.
<p>
The fives are built down and the sixes are built up, all by suit. Here's the
chart of which cards are placed on these cards:
<pre>
5  4  3  2  A  K
6  7  8  9 10  J
</pre>
<p>
After the foundation cards are found, the rest of the stock is dealt to look
for cards that can be built in to the foundations. In case the queens are
shuffled into the deck, when a queen is found, it is placed on the center.
<p>
Once the stock runs out, the cards are gathered from the wastepile and become
the new stock from which cards are to be dealt. This can only be done twice in
the whole game.
<p>
The game is won when all the cards are in the foundations with the face cards
(kings and jacks) are at the top of each foundation.
