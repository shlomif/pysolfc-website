<h1>Fifteens</h1>
<p>
Pairing game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Sixteen cards are dealt to the tableau.  Pairs of cards that are both ranked 9
or lower that total fifteen can be moved to the foundation, and the spaces
are filled from the talon.  Larger groups of cards that total 15 can also be
discarded by moving all of them to a special reserve pile.

type.  Similar to larger groups of 15, they are discarded by moving all four
cards to the reserve.
