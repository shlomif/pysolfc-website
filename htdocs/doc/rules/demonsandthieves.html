<h1>Demons and Thieves</h1>
<p>
Forty Thieves type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
There are nine tableau piles, divided into two sets.  The first set of tableau
piles contains four piles, each with a single card dealt to it, and are built
down by alternate color.  The second set consists of five piles, with eight
cards dealt to each, and are built down by same suit.  An additional thirteen
cards are dealt to a reserve pile, with only the top card face-up, and a single
card is dealt to a foundation, determining the base rank of the foundations.
<p>
Any card or valid sequence can be moved between tableau piles.  A sequence can
be moved from one set to the other, regardless of whether it matches the rules
of the piles it moved to, but in this case, the sequence cannot be moved further.
Cards from the reserve can be moved to an appropriate foundation or tableau pile
at any time.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time, and can be moved to the tableau or
foundations.  You have two redeals, so you can go through the deck three times.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit, starting from the rank dealt to the
first foundation at the start of the game, wrapping from king to ace as necessary.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
Demons and Thieves is a combination of Canfield-type and Forty Thieves-type
games.  It was invented by Thomas Warfield.
