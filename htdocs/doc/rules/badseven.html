<h1>Bad Seven (Die b&ouml;se Sieben)</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 stripped decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This game is played with two stripped decks, containing only
the sevens through kings of each suit, plus the aces.  Cards
are dealt to seven piles of seven cards, with every other card
dealt face-down (the second, fourth, and sixth cards in each
pile will be face-down).  When dealing, any ace that would be
dealt face-up is moved directly to the foundations.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by alternate color.  Any card or
valid sequence of cards can be moved between tableau piles.
Any card or sequence can fill empty tableau piles.
<p>
When there are no more moves, you can deal one card from the
talon to each tableau pile.  If the tableau is empty, you're
allowed one redeal.  For this redeal, the deck is shuffled,
and redealt as before, only this time, after all of the seven
piles have seven cards, any remaining cards are dealt to the
bottom of the piles face-up, until the deck is empty.
<p>
The foundations are built up by suit, with sevens being placed
on top of aces.  The game is won if all cards are moved to the
foundations.
