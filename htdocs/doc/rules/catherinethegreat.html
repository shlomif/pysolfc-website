<h1>Catherine the Great</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Both queens of clubs, diamonds and spades, plus one queen of hearts,
are dealt in an inverted U pattern in the center of the play area.  A king
of hearts is dealt in the center of the queens.  These form the foundations.
Then, a card is dealt to each of ten tableau piles, five to the left of the
foundations and five to the right.
<p>
Tableau piles are built up by rank regardless of suit, wrapping from king to
ace as necessary.  Empty piles are immediately filled from the talon or waste
pile.  If the talon and waste are empty, empty tableau piles can't be filled.
Cards can be dealt from the talon one at a time, and moved to tableau or
foundation piles.  No redeal is allowed.
<p>
The foundations with the queens are built down by same suit to king, turning
the corner from ace to king as necessary, while the middle foundation is built
up by same suit to queen, wrapping from king to ace as necessary.  The game
is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
