<h1>8 x 8</h1>
<p>
Klondike type. 2 decks. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
As the name implies, the eight playing
piles in the tableau all start with eight cards face-up.
<p>
Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space can be filled
with any card or sequence.
<p>
When you click on the talon, one card is turned over onto the waste pile.
There is no limit to the number of times you go through the talon.
<p>
You are also permitted to move cards back out of the foundation.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Try to go for an empty space.
