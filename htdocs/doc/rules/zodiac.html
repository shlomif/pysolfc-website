<h1>Zodiac</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Eight cards are dealt to eight free cells in a row.  This forms the
"equator".  Twenty-four additional cards are dealt to twenty-four tableau
piles both above and below the equator, called the "zodiac".
<p>
The zodiac piles are built up or down by same suit, cards from the equator or
waste pile can be moved to the zodiac, but cards cannot be moved between piles in
the zodiac, or to the foundations, until later in the game.  The equator consists
of eight free cells, that can only contain one card each.  When there are no moves
left, you can deal cards from the talon one at a time, and move them to the equator
or zodiac as possible.  You can go through the deck as many times as necessary.
<p>
Once all of the cards have been moved to the zodiac and equator, and the talon
and waste pile are both empty, you can start to move cards to the foundations.
Also, at this point, cards can be moved between piles in the zodiac.
<p>
One set of foundations is built up by same suit from ace to king, and the other
is built down from king to ace.  Each set of foundations gets one sequence for
each suit.  The game is won if all cards can be moved to the foundations.
