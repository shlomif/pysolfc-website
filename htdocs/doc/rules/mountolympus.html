<h1>Mount Olympus</h1>
<p>
Picture Gallery type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, the aces and twos are dealt
to sixteen foundation piles.  Nine cards are dealt to
nine tableau piles.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by suit, by twos.  So tableau
piles are either built in order K-J-9-7-5-3-A, or Q-10-8-6-4-2.
Any valid sequence of cards can be moved between tableau piles.
Empty tableau piles are filled with the top card from the stock -
once no cards are left in the stock, any card can be used
to fill the pile.
<p>
Foundation piles are built up by suit in the same manner.
<p>
When there are no moves available, deal an additional card from
the stock onto each tableau pile.  The game is won if all cards
are moved to the foundations.
