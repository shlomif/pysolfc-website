<h1>Crescent</h1>
<p>
Fan game type. 2 decks. 3 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
There are eight foundations.  At the start of the game, a king of
each suit is placed on the bottom of four of them, and an ace on the
other four.  The foundations that start with a king are built down
by suit, while the ones that start with an ace are built up.
<p>
The tableau consists of sixteen piles of six cards, and may be
built up or down by suit.  When building tableau piles, sequences
can turn the corner, so aces may be played on kings and vice versa.
However, this cannot be done in the foundation.
<p>
Empty tableau piles may not be filled.
<p>
Three redeals are allowed.  During each redeal, the bottom card of
each tableau pile is moved to the top of that pile.  The remaining
cards are unmoved.
