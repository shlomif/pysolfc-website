<h1>Mrs. Mop</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Mrs. Mop is a solitaire card game which is played using two decks of playing
cards. Invented by Charles Jewell, it is a distant relative of another
solitaire card game Spider where all of the cards are dealt. The game seems
easy at first, but when played, chances of winning are low.
<p>
First the cards are dealt into thirteen columns of eight cards each. The
player will then aim to form eight full suit sequences of 13 cards each. Every
sequence should run from King down to Ace.
<p>
To achieve this, the cards are built down regardless of suit. One card can be
moved at a time, unless there are two or more cards of the same suit forming a
sequence (such as 7-6-5-4 of spades) at which case they are moved as a single
unit.
<p>
When a suit sequence is formed on the same column, running from King down to
Ace (such as K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-A of clubs), the sequence is discarded.
This game is won when all eight such sequences are removed.
<p>
Like in Spider, it is generally a good idea for the player to built down in
suit whenever possible because the earlier this is done, the sooner a sequence
is removed, giving the player more space to maneuver.
