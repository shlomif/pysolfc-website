<h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
<p>
One-deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the red "fire" cards to the left five tableau piles and the black
"ice" cards to the right five tableau piles.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Five cards are dealt to each of ten tableau piles, with the leftmost and
rightmost piles receiving an extra card.  Any card or sequence of cards can
be moved between tableau piles, building down by rank, regardless of suit.
<p>
In this game, the red cards are called "fire" cards and the black cards are
called "ice" cards.  The object is to move all of the "fire" cards to the
leftmost five tableau piles, and all the "ice" cards to the rightmost five.
When dealing, a gap is left between the two sets of tableau piles to show
this clearer.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Fire and Ice was invented by David Bernazzani.
