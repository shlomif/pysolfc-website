<h1>Dutch Solitaire</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
An ace is dealt to each of five foundation piles, arranged in an X
pattern in the center of the play area.  Ten cards are dealt to each
of 6 tableau piles, arranged so only the top card is visible, with
one above and below the foundations, and two each to the left and
right.
<p>
Tableau and foundation piles are both built up or down by rank,
regardless of suit.  Single cards can be moved between piles.
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the talon
one at a time, and move them to appropriate piles.  No redeal is
allowed.  The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
