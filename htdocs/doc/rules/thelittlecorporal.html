<h1>The Little Corporal</h1>
<p>
Napoleon type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt into ten tableau piles, most with five cards, but the
outermost piles have four.  Four cards of the same rank are dealt to the
foundations.
<p>
Tableau piles can be built up or down by rank, by the same suit.  Only one
tableau card can be moved at a time.
<p>
Any card from the tableau can be moved to a single reserve pile.  This pile
can hold an unlimited number of cards, but only the topmost card in this
reserve can be moved, and only to a foundation or an empty tableau pile.
<p>
Foundations are built up or down by same suit, starting with the rank initially
dealt there, turning the corner as needed.  All four foundations must
be built in the same direction, which is determined by which card is moved
to a foundation first.  THe game is won if all cards are moved to the
foundations.
