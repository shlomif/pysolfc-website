<h1>Two Rings</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Fill all of the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The sixes and sevens are dealt to two rings of foundation
piles.  Eight cards are dealt to eight tableau piles.  The
foundations with the sevens are built up by suit to king,
while the foundations with the sixes are built down by suit
to aces.
<p>
No building on the tableau is allowed.  When there are no
moves left, one card can be dealt from the talon to each
tableau pile.  When the talon is empty, all the tableau
piles are placed together to make a new talon.  This can
only be done once.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are moved to the foundations
in the two rings.
