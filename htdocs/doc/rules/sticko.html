<h1>Sticko</h1>
<p>
One deck type. 1 stripped deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundation in a single sequence.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Sticko is played with a deck of only 32 cards, including the 7 through
ace of each suit.
<p>
Sixteen cards are dealt out to a "hand", and one card is moved to the
foundation as a starter.  Cards can be moved from this hand to the
foundation, if it meets one of the following rules:
<ul>
<li>The card is one rank higher than the card on top of the foundation,
and of the same suit.
<li>The card is one rank lower than the card on top of the foundation,
<li>The card is the same rank as the card on top of the foundation,
and of the opposite color.
</ul>
<p>
A card is dealt from the stock to replace each card moved to the foundation.
The game is won if the entire deck is moved to the foundation in a single
sequence.
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Sticko is a one player variation of the multiplayer card game Stucco, invented
by David Parlett.
