<h1>Casket</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The main tableau is set up in the shape of a casket, with the body of
the casket containing 8 cards, with a 5 card lid on top.  A face-down
reserve of 13 cards is placed inside the casket.  This reserve is called
the jewels.
<p>
The cards in the body of the casket are built down by same suit,
whereas the cards in the lid of the casket can't be built.  A card from
the lid of the casket can only be moved to a non-empty pile in the body
of the casket or a foundation.  Empty piles in the lid of the casket are
immediately filled with the top card from the jewels, while piles in
the body can be filled freely.
<p>
Deal cards from the stock one at a time.  Each card dealt from the stock
must be moved to one of three special reserve piles.  Cards from these
reserves can be moved to the body of the tableau or foundations.
<p>
Foundations are built up by suit, starting from aces.  The game is won if
all cards are moved to the foundations.
