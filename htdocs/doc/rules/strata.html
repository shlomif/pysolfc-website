<h1>Strata</h1>
<p>
Baker's Dozen type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The cards are dealt to eight piles of thirteen cards.  Tableau
piles are built down by alternate color.  Single cards can be moved
between tableau piles.  Cards can be moved to the foundations, which
are built up by same suit, starting from the ace.  Any card can fill
an empty tableau column.
<p>
When there are no moves left, the remaining tableau cards can be
reshuffled and redealt.  This can be done twice per game.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
