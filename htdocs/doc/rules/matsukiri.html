<h1>MatsuKiri</h1>
<p>
Hanafuda type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The cards can only be moved to the foundation as entire suits, in order.
As in <a href="oonsoo.html">Oonsoo</a>,
the third and fourth rank cards are interchangeable
for all suits except Rain.  Only first rank cards can play on the canvas.
First build the suits on the tableau.  Then pick up all four cards at
once and drop them on the foundation.  The foundation will only accept
a completed suit if the internal rank order is correct and it's played
in suit order.  Plum after Pine, Phoenix after Rain, etc.  Stacks in
the tableau can be moved if the cards in the stack are in order or
not.  There can be no more than twelve cards in a row.  The play in
this game is similar to Seahaven Towers, except there are no reserve
stacks.
<p>
This game can have "unbeatable" deals.  For instance, if the second
rank card of suit "a" is on the first rank card of suit "b", and the
second rank card of "b" is on the first rank card of "a", neither second
rank card can be moved.  You've lost.  It's also possible to play
yourself into a similar situation.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Hint: try to build more than one suit on the tableau at a time.
