<h1>Relaxed Lara's Game</h1>
Lara's game type. 2 decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="larasgame.html">Lara's Game</a>
with a redeal and a reserve stack.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Refer to the description of the deal in Lara's Game.  The differences
are the use of four decks instead of two two redeals and a reserve stack.
Otherwise the play and dealing rules are the same.
<p>
When the talon is empty after each round the cards are gathered up from
the tableau and dealt to the rows without being shuffled using the same
dealing rules as in the first round.  The foundations take two complete
rounds of a suit.  After the last card of the first round is played to
a foundation the first card of the second round will play.

<p>
The reserve stack will take any single card from the rows.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Use the reserve stack to allow buried cards to play.  The best time
to use it is just before the redeal.  Once played to the reserve a
card may only be played from it to a foundation.
