<h1>Tournament</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Eight cards are dealt out to two columns of four free cells.
These cards must contain at least one ace or king - if they
do not, they are immediately redealt.  Then, cards are dealt
to six tableau piles of four cards each.
<p>
There are two sets of foundations, one built up by same suit
from ace to king, and the others built down by same suit from
king to ace.  Each set contains one foundation of each suit.
Cards from the free cells or the tableau can be moved to the
foundations, but building on the tableau is not allowed.
Empty free cells can be filled with any card from the tableau.
<p>
When a tableau pile is empty, four cards from the talon are
dealt to fill it.  When there are no moves left, you can
deal four cards from the talon to each tableau pile.
<p>
Once the talon is empty, you can combine the tableau piles,
placing the rightmost one on top of the next rightmost one,
and so on.  You can redeal like this twice in the game.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are moved to the foundations.
