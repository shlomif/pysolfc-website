<h1>Alhambra</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, an ace and a king of each suit are
dealt to the foundations, and eight piles of four cards are
dealt as reserves.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock one at a time to the waste pile.
Cards from the reserves can be moved to the waste pile, which is
built up or down by same suit.  Cards from the reserve and waste
pile can also be moved to the reserves.
<p>
After the stock is empty, flip the waste pile and go through the
stock again, including the new cards that were added in that round.
Two redeals are allowed, so you can go through the deck up to
three times total.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
