<h1>Double Katrina's Game</h1>
Tarock game type. 4 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="larasgame.html">Lara's Game</a>
with twenty two rows and one redeal, using the Tarock deck.
This is the same as <a href="katrinasgamerelaxed.html">Relaxed Katrina's Game</a>
using four decks.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Refer to the description of the deal in Lara's Game.  The differences
are that the cards are dealt to twenty three piles instead of fourteen
and if a dealt card is of rank Page or over one card is dealt to the
talon.  Otherwise the dealing rules are the same.
<p>
Play is the same as Lara's Game with two exceptions.  The first exception
is that there are two redeals.  When the talon is empty after the one
round the cards are gathered up from the tableau and dealt to the rows
without being shuffled using the same dealing rules as in the first round.
<p>
The other exception is the reserve stack just to the right of the foundations.
This stack will take any three cards from any of the rows.  Once played there
however, a card may not be removed except by playing it to a foundation.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
If two row cards will play on the same foundation pick the card that is on
the row that holds the most cards.  Move cards from one set of foundations
to the other to get extra plays.
