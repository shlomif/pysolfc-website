<h1>Maze</h1>
<p>
Montana type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 12 cards in ascending sequence
by suit from Ace to Queen. There may be empty spaces between
but not within such sequences. The tableau wraps around.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and dealt
out to 54 piles. The Kings are then removed making a total of 6
initial free spaces.
<p>
You may move to a space only the card that
matches the neighbor in suit, and is one greater in rank than the left
neighbour or one less in rank than the right neighbour.
<p>
As a special rule you may place an Ace of any suit to the right
of a Queen.
<p>
The tableau wraps around at the end of rows and from the
bottom-right to the top-left.
