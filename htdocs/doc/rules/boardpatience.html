<h1>Board Patience</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
One card is dealt to the foundations at the start of
the game.  This card determines the base rank of the
foundations.  The foundations are built up by suit,
wrapping from king to ace as necessary.
<p>
There are ten tableau piles of five cards (except one
with six), and the tableau is built down by alternate
color, wrapping from ace to king as needed.  Cards may
only be moved one at a time, and empty spaces may be filled
with any card.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
