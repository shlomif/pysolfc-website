<h1>Flower Garden</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Flower Garden is a solitaire card game using a deck of 52 playing cards. It is
not known why the game is called such, but the terms used in this game do have
a relation to those in gardening and it takes merit that some skill is needed.
It is also known under the names <i>The Bouquet</i> and <i>The Garden</i>.
<p>
Thirty-six cards are dealt in to six columns, each containing six cards. The
columns are called the "flower beds" and the entire tableau is sometimes
called "the garden." The sixteen leftover cards become the reserve, or "the
bouquet."
<p>
The top cards of each flower-bed and all of the cards in the bouquet are
available for play. Cards can only be moved one at a time and can be built
either on the foundations or on the other flower beds. The foundations are
built up by suit, from Ace to King (a general idea of the game is to release
the aces first). The cards in the garden, on the other hand, can be built down
regardless of suit and any empty flower bed can be filled with any card. The
cards in the bouquet can be used to aid in building, be put into the
foundations, or fill an empty flower bed.
<p>
The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations.
