<h1>Flower Garden</h1>
<p>
Raglan type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to six columns of six cards each.  The
individual columns are called the flower beds, with the
entire tableau being called the garden.  An additional sixteen
cards are placed aside in a reserve called the bouquet.
<p>
The flower beds are built down by rank, regardless of suit.
Only single cards can be moved between flower beds, and any
card can fill an empty space.  Cards from the bouquet can be
moved to the garden or the foundations, but cards cannot be
moved to the bouquet.
<p>
The foundations are built up by suit from ace to king, and
the game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
