<h1>Footling</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The cards are dealt to eight tableau piles, four with seven
cards and four with six, all face-up.  Tableau piles are built
down by alternate color, and any card or valid sequence of cards
can be moved between tableau piles.  Any card or sequence can
fill an empty pile.  There are four free cells, that any single
cards can be moved to/from.
<p>
The foundations are built in a matter similar to
<a href="fourbyfour.html">Four by Four</a>.  The foundation is
built up with cards of the same rank, starting with aces.  Once
all four cards of that rank are in the foundation, you may place
cards with the next rank up.
