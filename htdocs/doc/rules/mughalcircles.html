<h1>Mughal Circles</h1>
Mughal Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

<h3>Quick description</h3>
The cards build down by rank and by suit on the tableau.  Any card may be
played on an empty row.  Only one card may be moved at a time.

<h3>Rules</h3>
All cards are dealt to the twenty four rows when the games begins.  Cards
on the tableau build down by suit in descending rank order.  The foundations
