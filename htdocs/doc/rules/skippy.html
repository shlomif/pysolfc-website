<h1>Skippy</h1>
<p>
Fan game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to sixteen piles of four cards each.  An additional
card is dealt to the foundation, this determines the base rank of the
foundations.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by rank, regardless of suit, wrapping from
ace to king as necessary.  Only single cards can be moved between tableau
piles.  Empty tableau piles can only be filled with a card of a rank one
below the base rank of the foundations (or kings, if the base rank is ace).
There are also four free cells, and any cards can be freely moved between
the free cells and the tableau.
<p>
You can deal cards from the talon one at a time, and move them to the
tableau or foundations.  No redeal is allowed.
<p>
The foundations are built up by suit, starting from the base rank, and
wrapping from king to ace as necessary.  The game is won if all cards
are moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Skippy was invented by Lillian Davies and Christa Baran.
