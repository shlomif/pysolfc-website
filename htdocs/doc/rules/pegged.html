<h1>Pegged</h1>
<p>
Pegged is a classic puzzle game also known as pegged solitaire.
It is traditionally played with pegs on a board rather than cards.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Remove all but one card.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This is a classic puzzle game. At the start of the game, one card is
removed. The remaining cards are removed by jumping over neighbour
cards, and the space beyond the neighbour must be empty.
<p>
You win when there is only one card left.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
To get awarded for a perfect game the remaining card must be
in the position of the initial free space.
<p>
The first card can be removed automatically, or chosen by the
player and removed manually. This is based on an assist level
option that can be set in the Options menu.
<p>
<i>Autodrop</i> and <i>Quickplay</i> are disabled for this game.
