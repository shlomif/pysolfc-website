<h1>Ishido Scored</h1>
<p>
Ishido game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all tiles to the playing area, and get the highest score possible.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href='ishido.html'>Ishido</a>, but with scoring.  Scoring works
as follows:
<ul>
<li>Each tile placed on the board scores depending on the number of adjacent
tiles.  Tiles placed on the edge of the play area do not score:
<ul>
<li>One adjacent tile: 1 point
<li>Two adjacent tiles: 2 points
<li>Three adjacent tiles: 4 points
<li>Four adjacent tiles: 8 points
</ul>
<li>A bonus of 25 points is scored each time a tile is placed next to four
adjacent tiles, forming a four-way match.
<li>After each four-way match is formed, the aforementioned scoring is doubled
for the rest of the game.
<li>At the end of the game, an additional bonus is given when there are only
a few tiles left to place - only the highest of these bonuses is received:
<ul>
<li>Two tiles left: 100 points
<li>One tile left: 500 points
<li>No tiles left: 1000 points
</ul>
</ul>
<p>With this scoring system, it is possible to gain higher scores without
successfully placing all the tiles than you can earn by placing the tiles.
Try and get the highest score possible.
