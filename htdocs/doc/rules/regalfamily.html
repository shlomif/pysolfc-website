<h1>Regal Family</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of twenty tableau piles, arranged in a
circle.  In the middle of the circle are three rows of
foundations.  The top and bottom rows are built down by same
suit from ten to ace, then turning the corner from ace to king
and down to jack, in the hearts, clubs, and spades.  The middle
row is for diamonds, and one foundation is built up from ace to
king and the other down from jack to queen, turning the corner
as necessary.
<p>
When no more cards can be moved to the foundations, you can deal
one card from the talon to each tableau pile.  Once the talon is
empty, you can move single cards between tableau piles, building
them up or down by same suit.  The game is won if all cards are
moved to the foundations.
