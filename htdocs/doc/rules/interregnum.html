<h1>Interregnum</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The foundations build up by rank ignoring suit. The base rank for
each foundation is one higher than the reserve above it.
<p>
Each foundation must be completed by using the card from the reserve above it.
<p>
There is no building on the tableau piles - cards can only be
moved to the foundations, and spaces are not filled.
<p>
When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card will be
added to each of the playing piles.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<i>Autodrop</i> is disabled for this game.
