<h1>Sixes and Sevens</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
All eight sixes and sevens are dealt out to sixteen
foundation piles.  Nine additional cards are dealt to the
tableau.  No building on the tableau is allowed.
<p>
The foundations that start with sixes are built down by
suit to ace while the foundations that start with sevens
are built up by suit to king.  A card can be moved from the
waste or the tableau to an appropriate foundation.  Empty
spaces on the tableau can be filled by any other card.
<p>
Cards can be dealt from the stock to the waste one at a time.
No redeal is allowed.  The game is won if all cards are
moved to the foundations.
