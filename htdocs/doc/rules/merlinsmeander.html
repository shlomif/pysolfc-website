<h1>Merlin's Meander</h1>
Braid type. Two decks. Two redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all suit cards to the Foundations.
<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="braid.html">Braid</a>
with <a href="../hexadeck.html">Hex A Deck</a>
variations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Braid.  In the Hex A Deck variation the Wizards
don't have their own foundations.  There are two reserve stacks to
the left of the foundations that will hold up to three Wizards each.
The game is won when all the suit cards have been moved to the foundations.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
Build sequences on the rows that will play when the correct card
turns over from the talon.  Don't fill the Wizard stacks until you
need to.
