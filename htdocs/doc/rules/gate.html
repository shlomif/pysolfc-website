<h1>Gate</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Gate is a solitaire card game which is playing using a deck of 52 playing
cards. It is called such because the cards are laid own in such a way that
they form a gate.
<p>
First, two columns of five cards are laid out face-up with their faces
showing. These act as the reserve or "gate posts." Then, between these
columns, two rows of four cards are dealt, again face-up. These compose the
"rails" or the tableau. The spaces for the foundations are allotted over the
first row of cards.
<p>
The object of the game, like solitaire games, is to find the aces, place then
onto the foundations, and build each of them up by suit to kings.
<p>
The cards in the rails are available for play, to be placed on the foundations
or onto other cards in the rail. The cards in the rails are built down by
alternating color (a card with a red suit over a one with a black suit, and
vice versa). Spaces in the rails are filled using cards from the gate posts.
If the cards in the gate posts are used up, the top card of the wastepile, or
the next card in the stock if there is no wastepile, can be used to fill
spaces. The gate posts are never replenished.
<p>
Generally, one card can be moved at a time. The most prevalent rule regarding
moves of sequences is that sequences can be moved as a whole. However, there
is a rule set which does not allow moving groups of cards, effectively making
the game harder (mentioned in <i>Card Games Made Easy</i> by Marks and Harrod,
ISBN 1-899606-17-3).
<p>
The stock can be dealt one card at a time to a wastepile. The top card of
which is available for play, either to placed in on the foundations or on the
rails, or to fill a gap on the rails. However, once the stock runs out, there
are no redeals.
<p>
The game ends soon after the stock runs out. The game is won when all cards
are played to the foundations.
