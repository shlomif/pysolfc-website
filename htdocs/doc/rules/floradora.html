<h1>Floradora</h1>
<p>
Forty Thieves type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Six cards are dealt to each of six tableau piles.  Tableau
piles are built down by rank, regardless of suit.  Single
cards can be moved between tableau piles.  Any card can be
moved to empty piles.  Cards can be dealt from the talon one
at a time and played to foundations or tableau piles.  No
redeal is allowed.
<p>
Foundations are built up by suit from ace to queen.  An
additional foundation, placed below the talon, accepts the
kings.  The game is won if all cards are moved to the
foundations.
