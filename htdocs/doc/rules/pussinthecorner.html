<h1>Puss in the Corner</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Puss in the Corner is a solitaire card game which is played with a deck of 52
playing cards. It is similar to another solitaire game Sir Tommy, but with
modifications and with the waste piles placed at the corners of the
foundations, hence the name.
<p>
First, the four aces are separated from the rest of the deck and placed side
by side in two cards of two, forming a square. The four waste piles, which
initially would contain a card each, are located at the corners of the square.
<p>
Building on the foundations is up by color (red suits on red, black suits on
black, no matter the suit) to kings. The player first examines the cards to
move any cards that can be built on the foundations. If a gap occurs, it is
not immediately filled. Only one card can be moved at a time.
<p>
After the sufficient cards are built, four cards, one at a time, are dealt
onto any of the wastepiles (not necessarily one on each waste piles).
Afterwards, any cards that can be built to the foundations are moved. There
should be no building on the wastepiles themselves. The process is repeated,
i.e. dealing four cards any on the wastepiles and moving any available cards
(the top card of each wastepile) to the foundations over and over, until the
stock is exhausted.
<p>
After the stock is exhausted, the player can do a redeal. To do this, the
player must pick up the four waste piles in any order one wishes, and without
shuffling, restarts dealing four cards, restarting the process. The game ends
when this second stock is used up.
<p>
The game is won when all the cards end up in the foundations.
