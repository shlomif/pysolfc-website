<h1>Puss in the Corner</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Four foundations are dealt in a square, with an ace dealt to each.
The foundations are built up by same color from ace to king.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time, and can be dealt to
one of four tableau piles in the corners of the play area, or an
appropriate foundation.  Cards moved to the tableau piles can only
be moved to the foundations.  If the talon is empty, these four
piles can be combined to make a new talon.  This can only be done
once.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are moved to the foundations.
