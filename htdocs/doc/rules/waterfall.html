<h1>Waterfall</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to eight piles of four cards each.
Tableau piles are built down by rank, regardless of
suit.  Any card or valid sequence of cards can be moved.
Any card or sequence can fill an empty space.  If there
are no moves left, you can deal one card from the talon to
each tableau pile.
<p>
The single foundation is built up by same suit, starting
with the ace of clubs, through the king of clubs.  Once
the king has been played, the ace of the next suit is the
next card to be played to the foundation.  The sequence
of suits is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Clubs</li>
<li>Spades</li>
<li>Hearts</li>
<li>Diamonds</li>
</ul>
<p>
After the king of diamonds is played, the suit changes back
to clubs, and so on until all the cards have been moved
to the foundation, and the game is won.
