<h1>Double Dot</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Eight cards are dealt to eight tableau piles, and the black aces
and red deuces are dealt to the foundations.  Tableau piles are
built down by rank, regardless of suit, building by every other
rank, wrapping from two to king or ace to queen as necessary.
Any card can fill an empty pile.
<p>
Foundations are built up by same suit, by every other rank,
wrapping in the same manner as necessary.
<p>
When there are no moves left, one card can be dealt to each tableau
pile from the stock.  The game is won if all cards are moved to
the foundations.
