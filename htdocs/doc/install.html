<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>
There is no need to compile anything since the whole program is just
a Python script. Just run it, and that's all.
<p>
PySol requires Python 2.3 and Tcl/Tk 8.4 or better. Both packages are
freely available for Unix, Windows and Macintosh platforms.
<p>
PySol is free <i>Open Source</i> software distributed under the terms of the
<a href="license.html">GNU GPL</a>.


<h2>Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000</h2>

PySol now ships as a completely self-contained setup file, so there's
no need to install anything else.
<p>
If you want to modify the PySol source code or write your own
Python programs you can get the development system from
<a href="http://www.python.org/download/download_windows.html">http://www.python.org/download/download_windows.html</a>


<h2>Unix</h2>

There are good chances that your system already ships with Python and Tcl/Tk.<br>
Otherwise visit
<a href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</a>
for full source code.
<p>
Also, installable packages exist for all major Linux distributions,
FreeBSD and HPUX.


<h2>Macintosh</h2>

Self installing exectuables for Python and Tcl/Tk are available from<br>
<a href="http://www.python.org/download/download_mac.html">http://www.python.org/download/download_mac.html</a>
<p>
As I don't have access to a Mac I'd appreciate any detailed feedback on
installation and look & feel. "Porting" from X11 to Windows only required some
minor changes in the default font settings, so I hope the situation on Macs is
similar.
<p>
[ I have been told that PySol works fine on a Mac - just drop "pysol.py"
  on the Python interpreter and that's it. But for some reason you must
  assign a large amount of memory to the Python interpreter. ]
