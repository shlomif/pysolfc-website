<h1>Solver</h1>
<p>
PySolFC contains integration with a number of solitaire game solvers:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">fc-solve</a>
<li><a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/black-hole-solitaire-solver/">Black Hole Solver</a>
</ul>
<p>
The solvers may need to be installed separately to use them, depending on your
PySol configuration.
<p>
To use the solver, first run a game that's compatible with the solver, and then set
the configuration settings.

<h2>Configuration Options</h2>
<p>
The preset option determines the configuration that the solver uses.  The different
configurations affect how the solver goes about trying to find a solution.  More
details on the different preset options can be found on the fc-solve website.
<p>
The max iterations setting controls how many game states the solver can review for
that given game.  A higher number means the solver is more accurate, but takes longer
to run.
<p>
Once you've set the configuration options, you can start the solver, and then demo the
found solution.
