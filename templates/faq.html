<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>The animation is too slow...</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately the Tcl/Tk toolkit lacks a sprite concept, so
there is a lot of (invisible double-buffered) redraw going on
when dragging cards around.
<p>
Disabling <i>Card shadow</i>, <i>Shade legal moves</i>,
background table tiles and sound will somewhat improve the display speed.

<h2>The table tiles look strange</h2>
<p>
Background table tiles should only be enabled when using
a true-color video mode - otherwise they may look bad
because of dithering.
<p>
BTW, you can add your own background tiles by copying the images
to the main <i>data/tiles</i> or your home <i>~/.PySolFC/tiles</i> directory.
<!-- They must be in GIF or PPM format. -->

<h2>My antivirus app says the Windows installer contains a virus.</h2>
<p>
We have been asked about the fact that some anti viruses, including those
on <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">VirusTotal</a>, have identified the Microsoft
Windows downloads as containing malware. What we know is that they are generated from
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">open source</a>
source code by <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a>, are checked using
VirusTotal before they are uploaded, and at that point were considered to be malware clean.
</p>

<p>
However, as time passes, they seem to accumulate classifyings as containing malware
in what appears to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives">false positives</a>. So we believe the downloads are nonetheless safe and free of
malware.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, note that we believe that many anti-malware applications are harmful
by themselves, and that they are all an incomplete (non-)solution to an
issue that does not exist in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Desktop">Linux</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_BSD_operating_systems">BSDs operating systems</a>.

<section id="spider">
<h2>It won't let me deal more cards in Spider.</h2>
<p>
When playing Spider, you are not allowed to deal more cards if there are any
empty piles.  If there aren't enough cards left to put one in each pile, the
game is lost.  Part of the game is planning ahead when to deal more cards to
avoid this situation.
</p>
<p>
If you want a variation without this rule, you can play Relaxed Spider instead.
