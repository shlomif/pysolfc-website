<h2>I received an error that there is no module named "formatter".</h2>
<p>
This error occurs if you're trying to run an older version of PySolFC
with Python 3.10.  If you are using Python 3.10 or later, please upgrade your
version of PySolFC to 2.14.0 or later - older versions are not compatible with
Python 3.10.
</p>
<p>
If you are getting your copy from your Linux distribution's package manager,
please contact the people who maintain the packages for your distribution.
You can always get the latest version from the PySolFC website or from
Flathub.
